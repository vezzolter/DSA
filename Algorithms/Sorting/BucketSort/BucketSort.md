# &#128161; Overview
The **Bucket Sort** (or **Bin Sort**) stands out as an efficient and simple sorting technique for uniformly distributed data. The algorithm is named for its key feature ‚Äî buckets (bins), which are containers used to temporarily store elements within a specific range of values. This subsection explores idea of bucket sort not only to enhance comprehension of its concepts, but also to establish a solid foundation for a more complex algorithmic designs and problem-solving strategies.

## Introduction
The **Bucket Sort** algorithm sorts a collection by distributing the elements into a number of buckets, then individually sorting each bucket (via placement or sorting) and finally concatenating all the sorted buckets back into a single sorted array. 


## Important Details
1. The underlying data structures for buckets are usually implemented as linked lists or arrays.
2. To determine the number of buckets to create, common methods include using the square root of the data size, a fixed number of buckets regardless of the size, the range of input values, or even data-driven approaches.
3. For sorting elements within buckets, standard library implementations are commonly used. However, insertion sort is suitable for small datasets, quicksort works well for medium-sized buckets, and merge sort is ideal for medium to large-sized buckets.


## Algorithm Steps
1. Calculate the number of buckets to use based on the size of the input array.
2. Identify the minimum and maximum values in the array to determine the range of values.
3. Compute the range of values that each bucket will hold.
4. Create and initialize the required number of buckets.
5. Place elements into corresponding bucket based on its value.
6. Sort the elements within each bucket.
7. Concatenate sorted elements from each bucket into the original array in order.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
The program initializes an array of specified integers, performs ascending order sorting using the bucket sort algorithm, and finally displays the result.

## Design Decisions
To prioritize simplicity and emphasize algorithm itself, several design decisions were made:
- Utilizing a library implementation of dynamic array `vector<int>` both as collection and buckets.
- Determining the number of buckets via square method, and library `sqrt()` + `ceil` functions.
- Calculating the range of each bucket is done via `max_element()` and `min_element()` functions.
- Sorting elements within buckets is done via library implementation `sort()` of sorting function.
- Exclusively implementing sorting in ascending order.
- Omitting certain optimizations to the algorithm.


## Complete Implementation
Sorting algorithm implemented within the `bucketSort()` function with a few helper ones `findMax()` and `findMin()`, which are declared `BucketSort.h` header file and defined in `BucketSort.cpp` source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity and compilation efficiency. Examination of sorting technique is conducted within the `main()` function located in the `Main.cpp` file. Below you can find related code snippets.

```cpp
int findMax(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    return *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
}

int findMin(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    return *std::min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
}

void bucketSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int nBuckets = static_cast<int>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(n)));

    int minVal = findMin(arr);
    int maxVal = findMax(arr);
    int rangePerBucket = (maxVal - minVal + 1) / nBuckets + 1;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> buckets(nBuckets);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int idBucket = (arr[i] - minVal) / rangePerBucket;
        buckets[idBucket].push_back(arr[i]);
    }

    arr.clear();
    for (int i = 0; i < nBuckets; ++i) {
        std::sort(buckets[i].begin(), buckets[i].end());
        for (int j = 0; j < buckets[i].size(); ++j) {
            arr.push_back(buckets[i][j]);
        }
    }
}
```


## Detailed Walkthrough
1. Calculate the number of buckets by taking the square root of the number of elements. This heuristic helps balance the size of each bucket, making sorting within each bucket more efficient.
```cpp
  int n = arr.size();
  int nBuckets = static_cast<int>(std::ceil(std::sqrt(n)));
```
2. Identify the minimum and maximum values in the array to determine the range of values. This ensures that each bucket covers an equal portion of the overall range of data. To calculate such value we calculate the total range of values in the array `maxVal - minVal + 1` (adding `+ 1` ensures that the range includes both min and max), and dividing by `nBuckets` splits the range into approximately equal parts, after that we add `+ 1` to ensure that the range is slightly larger, which helps in avoiding cases where the calculated range per bucket is zero.
```cpp
  int minVal = findMin(arr);
  int maxVal = findMax(arr);
  int rangePerBucket = (maxVal - minVal + 1) / nBuckets + 1;
```
3. Initialize a vector of vectors to serve as the buckets and iterate through it placing each element into the appropriate bucket based on its value. To calculate such id of such bucket we shift all the values so that the smallest one in the array becomes zero (this ensures that the values are correctly mapped to bucket indices starting from zero) via `arr[i] - minVal`, and also divide by `rangePerBucket`, which groups the values based on their range. For example, `(7 - 0) / 4 = 1` moves value `7` to the first bucket, `(9 - 0) / 4 = 2` moves value `9` to second bucket.
```cpp
  std::vector<std::vector<int>> buckets(nBuckets);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int idBucket = (arr[i] - minVal) / rangePerBucket;
      buckets[idBucket].push_back(arr[i]);
  }
```
4. Prepare the array to receive the sorted elements from the buckets by removing all the original elements. Iterate over buckets and apply sorting procedure of your choice (described earlier). Finally, iterate over sorted elements of each bucket, and push them back into initial array, thus forming the sorted one.
```cpp
  arr.clear();
  for (int i = 0; i < nBuckets; ++i) {
      std::sort(buckets[i].begin(), buckets[i].end());
      for (int j = 0; j < buckets[i].size(); ++j) {
          arr.push_back(buckets[i][j]);
      }
  }
```



# &#128202; Analysis
Understanding the characteristics of an algorithm is essential for choosing the right solution to a problem, as it reveals their impact on resource utilization, potential limitations and capabilities. Comparing the algorithm with other approaches provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses, helping to make informed decisions in various scenarios.


## Algorithm Characteristics
- **Comparison Approach:**
  - **Comparison-Based (Implementation Dependent)** ‚Äî while algorithm itself uses non-comparison idea of distributing and concatenating buckets, it uses comparison-based sorting algorithm within each bucket, which makes this algorithm a comparing one.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - **Worst Case** from $O(n\log n)$ to $O(n^2)$ ‚Äî occurs when the distribution is poor (elements have similar values and therefore fall into the same bucket). The time complexity becomes dependent on the worst case of sorting algorithm within the bucket, along with the overhead of distributing elements into buckets and combining them back into the original array.
  - **Average Case** $O(n + n\log (n / k))$ ‚Äî occurs when the distribution is reasonably good (elements have distinct values that can be evenly grouped and therefore fall into evenly sized buckets). The time complexity depends on the average case performance of the sorting algorithm within the bucket, along with the overhead of distributing elements into buckets and combining them back into the original array.
  - **Best Case** $O(n + k)$ ‚Äî occurs when the elements are uniformly distributed, with each bucket containing at most one element. This eliminates the need for sorting within the buckets, leaving only the overhead of distributing elements into buckets and combining them back into the original array.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - **Array Implementation** $O(n + k)$ ‚Äî algorithm requires additional space for temporary storage (buckets), and depending on sorting algorithm it may require some memory also.
- **Stability:**
  - **Stable (Implementation Dependent)** ‚Äî algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements, particularly when implemented with a stable sorting within buckets like insertion or merge.
- **Adaptability:**
  - **Non-Adaptive** ‚Äî algorithm does not inherently adapt its strategy to different input distributions, i.e., it processes data through the same path of steps, regardless of their values.
- **Storage:**
  - **Internal** ‚Äî algorithm typically implemented to be an internal sorting.

# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of an algorithm is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Common Use Cases
- **Uniformly Distributed Data** ‚Äî bucket sort is highly efficient for datasets where the input values are uniformly distributed. It works best when the data can be evenly spread across multiple buckets, ensuring that each bucket contains a similar number of elements; e.g. floating-point numbers, geographical data.
- **Parallel Processing** ‚Äî bucket sort is an efficient decision to implement a sorting utilizing a multiple processors at once. By dividing the input into several buckets, these buckets can be sorted independently in parallel, taking advantage of multiple processors; e.g. distributed computing systems, multi-core processors.
