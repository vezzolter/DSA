# &#128161; What is the Sorting

**Sorting** is a widely used operation in computer science to arrange items in a particular order. It helps to organize data efficiently in various algorithms and for all manner of applications, therefore it is important to truly understand the concept.

**Sorting Algorithm** ‚Äî set of steps used to arrange elements in a specific order. It introduces the following terms:
- **Collection** ‚Äî a grouping of elements arranged in a specific order.
- **Specific Order** ‚Äî the arrangement of elements within a collection based on a defined set of criteria. 
- **Criterion** ‚Äî a rule used to make the decisions about the order of elements.
- **Element** ‚Äî an individual entity within a collection.
- **Index of an Element** ‚Äî the position of an element within collection.
- **Value of an Element** ‚Äî the actual data stored within the element.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
When it comes to implementation, while particular sorting algorithms share some common ideas, each possesses distinctive characteristics and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the case at hand. Overall sorting algorithms can be broadly classified by:

- **Comparison Approach:**
   - **Comparison-Based** ‚Äî sort elements by comparing them using pairwise comparisons to determine their relative order; suitable for scenarios where the comparison of elements' values are practical and necessary.
   - **Non-Comparison-Based** ‚Äî sort elements without explicitly comparing them, often using specific properties of data; suitable for scenarios where the comparison of elements' values are impractical and unnecessary.

- **Auxillary Memory Consumption:**
   - **In-Place** ‚Äî do not require additional memory, except stack or table; suitable for small-medium amount of data.
   - **Out-of-Space** ‚Äî require some additional memory (e.g. pointers, indices, copies of a collection); suitable for massive amount of data.

- **Adaptability:**
   - **Adaptive** ‚Äî sequences of operations depends on comparison result; suitable for varying input data.
   - **Non-Adaptive** ‚Äî sequences of operations disregard the comparison result; suitable for relatively consistent input data.

- **Stability:**
   - **Stable** ‚Äî preserve the relative order of equal elements; suitable for the data, which has multiple essential criteria.
   - **Unstable** ‚Äî disregard the relative order of equal elements; suitable for the data, which prioritize only efficiency.

- **Directness:**
   - **Direct Algorithms** ‚Äî sort elements, directly manipulating the elements themselves to reorder them; suitable for small amount of data.
   - **Indirect Algorithms** ‚Äî sort elements, via manipulating the identifiers, rather then actual data; suitable for massive amount of data.

- **Place of collection allocation:**
   - **Internal** ‚Äî takes place entirely within the main memory (RAM) of computer; suitable for small amount of data.
   - **External** ‚Äî takes place within other devices (e.g. hard disk); suitable for massive amount of data.
