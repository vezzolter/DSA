# &#128161; What is the Bubble Sort
The **Bubble Sort** stands out as the simplest and one of the earliest known sorting technique, renowned for its straightforward implementation. The algorithm is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up (move) to the top of the list. Knowledge and understanding of it, lays the foundation for tackling more complex sorting methods and problem-solving strategies.

**Bubble Sort** iterates over a collection, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This way, in each pass of the algorithm, the largest unsorted element move to its correct position at the end of the collection, much like bubbles gradually rising in water. It consists of the following steps:
1. Start at the beginning of the collection.
2. Compare the first two elements.
3. If the order of them is wrong, swap them; otherwise skip this step.
4. Move to the next pair.
5. Repeat this process until no more swaps are needed.
