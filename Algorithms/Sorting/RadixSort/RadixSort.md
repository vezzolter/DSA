# &#128161; Overview
The **Radix Sort** stands out as one of the most well-known non-comparative sorting technique. The name of algorithm describes its method of sorting numbers by processing individual digits according to their position within the base (radix) of the number system. This subsection explores idea of radix sort not only to enhance comprehension of its concepts, but also to establish a solid foundation for a more complex algorithmic designs and problem-solving strategies.

## Introduction
The **Radix Sort** processes each digit of the numbers, starting from the least significant (rightmost) to the most significant (leftmost), and sorts the numbers by distributing them into buckets based on each digit, then collecting them back into a sorted sequence after each digit processing step.


## Important Details
1. Can be applied to data that can be sorted lexicographically (e.g. integers, words, punch cards, playing cards).
2. Requires modification to handle floating-point numbers, negative integers, or strings of variable lengths, which can add overall complexity to the algorithm.
3. Works best when the numbers have the same number of digits, otherwise they need to be padded.


## Algorithm Steps
1. Determine the maximum number of digits in the largest number.
2. Initialize 10 buckets for each digit (0-9).
3. Sort the numbers by their least significant digit.
4. Collect the numbers from the buckets back into the original list.
5. Sort the numbers by the next significant digit.
6. Collect the numbers from the buckets back into the original list.
7. Repeat the sorting and collecting steps for each digit until the most significant digit of hte largest element has been processed.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
The program initializes an array of specified integers, performs ascending order sorting using the radix sort algorithm, and finally displays the result.

## Design Decisions
To prioritize simplicity and emphasize algorithm itself, several design decisions were made:
- Utilizing an array of positive integers as a collection.
- Exclusively implementing sorting in ascending order.
- Omitting certain optimizations to the algorithm.


## Complete Implementation
Sorting algorithm implemented within the `radixSort()` function with a few helper ones `getMax()` and `countingSort()`, which are declared `RadixSort.h` header file and defined in `RadixSort.cpp` source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity and compilation efficiency. Examination of sorting technique is conducted within the `main()` function located in the `Main.cpp` file. Below you can find related code snippets.

```cpp
int getMax(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) { max = arr[i]; } 
    }

    return max;
}

void countingSort(int arr[], int n, int digitPos) {
    const int range = 10; // since digits are 0-9
    int* output = new int[n];
    int count[range] = { 0 };

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int digit = (arr[i] / digitPos) % 10;
        count[digit]++;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < range; i++) { count[i] += count[i - 1]; }  

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        int digit = (arr[i] / digitPos) % 10;
        output[count[digit] - 1] = arr[i];
        count[digit]--;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { arr[i] = output[i]; }
    delete[] output;
}

void radixSort(int arr[], int n) {
    int max = getMax(arr, n);

    for (int digitPos = 1; max / digitPos > 0; digitPos *= 10) {
        countingSort(arr, n, digitPos);
    }
}
```


## Detailed Walkthrough
1. Start by determining the number of digits in the largest number, which in turn determines how many passes of sorting are needed. To do so, you can simply iterate over a collection and update the max value, or resort to library implementations.
```cpp
  int max = getMax(arr, n);
```
2. Then sort array based on the current digit place, until all digits of the largest element are processed. Initialize digit position to the least significant digit, which is first from end. Loop condition ensures that the loop runs until all digit places of the maximum number are processed. After each iteration multiply position by $10$ to move to the next digit.
```cpp
  for (int digitPos = 1; max / digitPos > 0; digitPos *= 10) {
      countingSort(arr, n, digitPos);
  }
```
3. At this moment, the control flow goes to the `countingSort()` function, which starts by initializing required variables: `range` to define the number of possible digit values that can appear at any given digit position, `output` to store the sorted numbers temporarily, `count` to store the count of occurrences of each digit. Basically, you can also resort to library implementations, such as vector and hash map.
```cpp
  const int range = 10; // since digits are 0-9
  int* output = new int[n];
  int count[range] = { 0 };
```
4. Then the interesting part comes, where all the actual sorting occurs. First we need to know how many time each digit appears at the current digit position across all numbers, this helps us to understand the distribution of digits and prepares us for placing the numbers in the correct order in the next steps; e.g. if we are looking at the units position, then: for $328$ its $8$, for $3$ its $3$, for $203$ its $3$, and then count $8$ appears once, $3$ appears twice.
```cpp
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      int digit = (arr[i] / digitPos) % 10;
      count[digit]++;
  }
```
5. After counting the appearances, we transform them into cumulative count array, so that we could know the exact position in the sorted array, where each digit should go.
```cpp
  for (int i = 1; i < range; i++) { count[i] += count[i - 1]; }
```
6. Knowing all that info, we are able to sort the digits. We iterate over the original array from the last element to the first (this reverse order helps in maintaining the stability of the sort), for each number we extract the digit at the current position, by using cumulative count array we place the number in the output array and update the position for the next occurrence of the same digit.
```cpp
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      int digit = (arr[i] / digitPos) % 10;
      output[count[digit] - 1] = arr[i];
      count[digit]--;
  }
```
7. Finally, simply copy output array to initial one and clear the memory.
```cpp
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { arr[i] = output[i]; }
  delete[] output;
```



# &#128202; Analysis
Understanding the characteristics of an algorithm is essential for choosing the right solution to a problem, as it reveals their impact on resource utilization, potential limitations and capabilities. Comparing the algorithm with other approaches provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses, helping to make informed decisions in various scenarios.


## Algorithm Characteristics
- **Comparison Approach:**
  - **Non-Comparison-Based** ‚Äî algorithm sorts elements by processing their individual digits or characters, not by comparing entire elements directly.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - **All Cases** $O(d √ó (n + k))$ ‚Äî algorithm applies counting sort, which is $O(n + k)$, a total of $d$ times, where $d$ represents the total number of digits (or chars) in the largest number (or string).
- **Space Complexity:**
  - **Array Implementation** $O(n + k)$ ‚Äî algorithm requires additional space for temporary storage (buckets or count array).
- **Stability:**
  - **Stable** ‚Äî algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements, particularly when implemented with a stable intermediate sort like counting sort.
- **Adaptability:**
  - **Non-Adaptive** ‚Äî algorithm does not inherently adapt its strategy to different input distributions, i.e., it processes data through the same path of steps, regardless of their values.
- **Storage:**
  - **Internal** ‚Äî algorithm typically implemented to be an internal sorting.

# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of an algorithm is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Common Use Cases
- **Large Dataset Sorting** ‚Äî radix sort is ideal for sorting large datasets of integers or fixed-length strings where the range of values (digits or characters) is limited. Its linear time complexity makes it efficient for such applications; e.g. sorting telephone numbers, zip codes.
- **Parallel Processing** ‚Äî radix sort is an efficient decision to implement a sorting utilizing a multiple processors at once. By dividing the input into several buckets based on digit positions, these buckets can be sorted independently in parallel, taking advantage of multiple processors; e.g., distributed computing systems, multi-core processors.

# &#x1F559; Origins
Radix Sort was first introduced by **Herman Hollerith** in **1887**. Hollerith was an American statistician who devised the concept while working on a system to process data from the U.S. Census. The initial idea behind Radix Sort was to efficiently process and sort punched cards used in data tabulation. Hollerith's method sorted the cards based on the values of individual columns, effectively organizing large amounts of data without directly comparing entire records. The algorithm saw increased usage in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in systems where efficient, non-comparative sorting was necessary. Its ability to handle large datasets with predictable performance made it valuable in various applications, including database management and information retrieval.
