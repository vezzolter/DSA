# &#128161; Overview
The **Heapsort** stands out as one of the most well-known and efficient sorting technique. The author named algorithm for its use of the heap data structure property, which implies that keys of parent nodes are either greater than or equal to those of their children (in a max heap) or less than or equal to those of their children (in a min heap). This subsection explores idea of heapsort not only to enhance comprehension of its concepts, but also to establish a solid foundation for a more complex algorithmic designs and problem-solving strategies.
