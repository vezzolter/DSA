# &#128161; What is the Linear Search
The **Linear Search** stands out as the simplest known approach to search for an element in a collection. The algorithm is named for the way it applies linear (or also known as sequential) manner to the search. Knowledge and understanding of it, lays the foundation for tackling more complex searching algorithms and problem-solving strategies.

**Linear Search** sequentially checks each element of the collection from the beginning until a match is found or the end of the collection is reached, pretty much like the intuitive process of looking for a particular book on a shelf where are only unnamed ones. It consists of the following steps:
1. Begin with the first element of the collection.
2. Compare the current element with the target element.
3. If the current elment matches the target one, the search is successful, return an index.
4. Otherwise, move to the next element in the collection.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until either a match is found or the end of the collection is reached.
6. If the entire collection has been traversed without finding a match, the search is unsuccessful, return a signal.
