# &#128161; What is the Searching
**Searching** is a widely used operation in computer science to retrieve information. It helps to locate specific items or data within datasets in various algorithms and for all manner of applications, therefore it is important to truly understand the concept.

**Essential Terminology:**
- **Searching Algorithm** — is a set of steps used to retrieve a particular element within a collection of data.
  - **Successful Search** — is an outcome in which algorithm found the element(-s) containing argument. 
  - **Unsuccessful Search** — is an outcome in which algorithm didn't the element(-s) containing argument.
- **Collection** — is a data structure, which is used to group multiple elements together.
  - **Table** — is a small collection of all elements.
  - **File** — is a big collection of all elements.
  - **Database** — is a large collection of all elements.
- **Element/Record/Item** — is an individual entity within a collection.
  - **Index/Key of Element** — is a position of an element within collection.
  - **Value/Data of Element** — is an actual information stored within the element.
- **Argument** — is a parameter passed to an algorithm, which provides the criteria, which will be used to find the desired element.
- **Criterion** — is a rule used to determine whether an element meets the requirements of the search.
