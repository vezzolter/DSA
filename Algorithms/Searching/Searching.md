# &#128161; Overview
**Searching** is a fundamental operation in both the real world and computer science, used to locate specific items or data within a dataset. Mastering this concept is essential ‚Äî not only for its standalone applications, such as finding a contact in a phone book, but also for its role in facilitating and optimizing other algorithms by efficiently retrieving relevant information.

## Essential Terminology
- **Searching Algorithm** ‚Äî is a set of steps used to retrieve a particular element within a collection of data.
  - **Successful Search** ‚Äî is an outcome in which algorithm found the element(-s) containing argument. 
  - **Unsuccessful Search** ‚Äî is an outcome in which algorithm didn't the element(-s) containing argument.
- **Criterion** ‚Äî is a rule used to determine whether an element meets the requirements of the search.
- **Collection** ‚Äî is a data structure, which is used to group multiple elements together.
  - **Table** ‚Äî is a small collection of all elements.
  - **File** ‚Äî is a big collection of all elements.
  - **Database** ‚Äî is a large collection of all elements.
  - **Search Interval/Space**  ‚Äî is subset of a collection, that is being searched and it may change dynamically depending on the algorithm.
- **Element/Record/Item** ‚Äî is an individual entity within a collection.
  - **Index** ‚Äî is a position of an element within collection.
  - **Value/Data** ‚Äî is an actual information stored within the element.
  - **Key** ‚Äî is a unique identifier or attribute associated with an element in a collection, can be used as the primary criterion for different operations.
  - **Target Element** ‚Äî is a one that search algorithm seeks to find within a collection, serves as a reference for comparison.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
When implementing a concept, it's essential to understand the fundamental techniques that drive its behavior and ensure its correct functionality. Additionally, recognizing the critical pitfalls and potential optimizations allows you to refine the implementation, making it more efficient and robust for various scenarios.


## How to Implement
There isn't a universal search algorithm that works optimally in every scenario. This is because the nature of the data, its storage, and the specific requirements of the problem, which can vary widely ‚Äî all of those factors, influence the choice. Fortunately, there aren't too many searching algorithms to cover, so I suggest categorizing them into two main approaches:  
  
- **Sequential Search (Only 1)** ‚Äî elements are examined one by one until the target is found or the search reaches the end of the collection.  
**Examples:** Linear Search.

- **Interval Searches** ‚Äî work by dividing the search space into intervals and focusing on the relevant section.  
**Examples:** Binary Search, Interpolation Search.

> **Note:** Unfortunately, I couldn't find any resource that would extensively cover this concept, which likely indicates that mastering it in great depth isn't as crucial/required. Therefore,  I recommend focusing primarily on the different ways linear and binary search algorithms, as these will cover the vast majority of search-related problems you'll encounter in day-to-day tasks.


## Pitfalls and Optimizations
Currently in Progress...


## Implemented Algorithms
Discussing practical implementations, it's evident that well-established and widely recognized solutions already exist. In the context of C++, `std::find()` and `std::binary_search()` are such representatives. It's commonly recommended to rely on these proven implementations rather than reinventing the wheel. However, within the scope of this section, we'll take a closer look at simplified versions of popular searching algorithms. This exploration is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental design paradigms that underlie them.

# &#128202; Analysis
Understanding how to analyze a concept is crucial for identifying its key characteristics and evaluating its performance across different scenarios. Additionally, examining the trade-offs allows you to understand what you gain and what you give up when applying the concept. Finally, considering alternatives helps you determine when the concept is the best choice and when other approaches might be more appropriate.


## How to Analyze
- **Time Complexity:**
  - $O(1)$ ‚Äî occurs when the search operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the dataset, usually via known key and straightforward access.
   - $O(log(n))$ ‚Äî occurs when the search operation divides the search space in half with each step.
  - $O(n √ó log(n))$ ‚Äî occurs when the time of search increases linearly with the size of collection and also influenced by logarithmic factor due to divide-and-conquer strategies.
   - $O(n)$ ‚Äî occurs when the search operation examines each element one by one, therefore making its time proportional to the size of the collection.
   - $O(n^2)$ ‚Äî can occur in certain nested loop-based search algorithms where each element is compared with every other element in the collection.
   - $O(2^n)$ ‚Äî typically associated with brute-force search algorithms that explore all possible combinations of elements.
   - **Other** ‚Äî although they are in the minority, it is worth mentioning them.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
   - **In-Place** $\big(O(1)\big)$  ‚Äî algorithm does not require any additional memory.
   - **Out-of-Space** $\big(O(n)/O(n√ólogn)/...\big)$ ‚Äî algorithm does require some additional memory.  

- **Element's Mutability:**
   - **Static** ‚Äî contents of the collection either rarely change or don't change at all.
   - **Dynamic** ‚Äî contents of the collection frequently change.

- **Key Representation:**
   - **Actual Keys** ‚Äî refers to the original keys or values used for identification and retrieval within the search algorithm.
   - **Transformed Keys** ‚Äî refers to the keys, that have undergone some form of transformation (e.g. encryption, different format, preprocessing, etc) to optimize the search process.

- **Adaptability:**
   - **Adaptive** ‚Äî algorithm adjusts its overall behavior (sequence of operations) based on the initial order of elements to improve performance.
   - **Non-Adaptive** ‚Äî data processed through the same path of steps, regardless of their values.

- **Storage:**
   - **Internal** ‚Äî algorithm takes place entirely within the main memory (RAM) of computer.
   - **External** ‚Äî algorithm takes place within other storage devices (e.g. hard disk), typically due to their huge size.


## Trade-Offs
**What Searching Gives:**
- **Quick Data Retrieval** ‚Äî searching algorithms allow for the efficient retrieval of specific elements from datasets, reducing the time and effort needed to find information. This efficiency is crucial in applications where data access speed is critical, such as databases or real-time systems.
- **Improved Algorithm Performance** ‚Äî searching is a fundamental operation that supports and enhances many other algorithms and systems. By having robust searching capabilities, more complex and efficient applications can be developed.

**What Searching Takes:**
- **Time Consumption** ‚Äî searching can require significant time, especially in large, unsorted datasets. This time cost becomes a critical factor in applications where speed is essential, as inefficient searches can lead to performance bottlenecks.
- **Space Consumption** ‚Äî some search algorithms, particularly recursive ones, may need additional memory. This extra memory usage can impact performance, especially in environments with limited resources.
- **Data Requirements** ‚Äî certain search algorithms depend on the data being sorted, which introduces a preprocessing step. This requirement can complicate implementation and affect overall performance, especially in dynamic datasets where data changes frequently.
- **Implementation Intricacies** ‚Äî implementing search algorithms can involve handling edge cases, such as duplicates or missing elements, adding complexity to the code. This complexity might introduce bugs or make the code harder to maintain.

# &#x1F559; Origins
The concept of searching emerged unknown-long time ago and primarily attributed to the collective ingenuity of humanity, the development of searching algorithms dates back in the early days of computing. The first search algorithms, such as **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** quickly gained widespread adoption and underwent continuous development by programmers worldwide, becoming a fundamental component in various applications. As people started to utilize tree and graph based data structures more, the relevant search algorithms like following ones appeared: **DFS**, **BFS**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, **A\***, **Greedy Best-First Search**, ‚Äî which are still extremely valuable and efficient to this day. Another breakthrough came with the rising popularity of the internet, which created a need in sophisticated and complex search engines, that could both filtrate the large amounts of different data and decide what is relevant. One notable invention, that revolutionized web search was the **PageRank** developed by **Larry Page** and **Sergey Brin** in **1996**, which first prototype was utilized at **Google** in **1998**. Nowadays the direction of searching tend to utilize the **AI** and **NLP** driven ideas in order to deliver more accurate search results.
