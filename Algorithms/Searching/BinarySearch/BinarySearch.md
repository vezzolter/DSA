# &#128161; What is the Binary Search
The **Binary Search** stands out as one of the most fundamental approaches to search for an element in the ordered collection. The algorithm is named for the way it divides the search interval in half. Knowledge and understanding of it, lays a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.

**Binary Search** repeatedly divides the search interval of an ordered collection until a match is found or the interval is empty, pretty much like the intuitive process of looking for a particular page in some type of dictionary without any prior knowledge of its content or index. It consists of the following steps:
1. Make sure the collection is in sorted order.
2. Calculate the midddle index.
3. Compare target element with middle one.
   - if target **matches** with middle, the search is successful, **return** the index.
   - if target is **less** then middle, continue the search on the **left** half of a collection.
   - if target is **greater** then middle, continue the search on the **right** half of a collection.
4. Repeat previous steps until either target element is found or the search interval is empty.

# &#x23F3; Historical Notes
The idea of Binary Search has evolved over time and there is no single individual behind them, especially because historical origins are not always well-recorded. In terms of computer science, it was one of the earliest searching algorithms to be implemented in early computer programs. Since then, many others have contributed to its understanding, analysis, and optimization.
