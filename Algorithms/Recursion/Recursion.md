# &#128161; What is Recursion

**Recursion** is a widely used idea in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler ones. It helps to develop elegant & efficient data structures and algorithms for all manner of applications. Many important implementations use recursion, so it's important to understand the concept.

**Recursive Algorithm** ‚Äî is one that solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. Implemented via recursive functions.


## Implementation

**Recursive Function** ‚Äî is one that calls itself and has two main components:
1. **Base Case** ‚Äî represents a situation, where the solution is directly known (already provided) without requiring further recursion.
2. **Recursive Case** ‚Äî represents other situation, where the solution to the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
  
Not all mathematically recursive functions are efficiently (or correctly) implemented by C++‚Äôs simulation of recursion. Recursion is used when it makes the solution clearer. In order to make a good use of this approach, it's worth to consider a few deducable guidelines for designing:

1. **Termination conditions** ‚Äî there must always be some base cases that can be solved without resorting to recursion. Otherwise it may lead to infinite recursion.
2. **Making progress** ‚Äî  it's essential that each recursive call contributes to progress towards reaching a base case, making sure that termination conditions are reachable.
3. **Trust the encapsulation** ‚Äî assume the functionality of all recursive calls is correct. This attempt to trace the sequence of calls, may spend unnecessary time, which actually, can be an indication of a good use of recursion, since the computer is being allowed to work out the complicated details.
4. **No duplicating** ‚Äî the recursion should avoid duplicating work by solving the same instance of a problem in distinct recursive calls, because it could lead to inefficiencies and unnecessary computations.
