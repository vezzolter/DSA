# &#128161; Overview
The **Fibonacci sequence** is one of the simplest and earliest known sequences defined by a recurrence relation, which stands among the fundamental mathematical patterns with widespread applications in algorithms and data structures. It is named after Leonardo of Pisa, who introduces it to Western mathematics. Knowledge and understanding of it, lays a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.

## Introduction
**Fibonacci Sequence** is a series of numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Traditionally starts with $0$ and $1$ (but can start with different initial values), forming following sequence: $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 89, 144, 233, 377$ and so on. The terms of this sequence are known as **Fibonacci numbers** and can be denoted as $F_n$, therefore general formula can be recursively written as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.


## Important Details
- The other related concept to the Fibonacci Sequence is **golden ratio** ($\Phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} ‚âà 1.61803398875$) ‚Äî is an irrational number, which appears between ratio of bigger and smaller value, holding property: $\frac{bigger+smaller}{bigger} = \frac{bigger}{smaller} = \phi$
- Ratio of any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, gets closer to the golden ratio ($\Phi$) as the numbers get larger,  
e.g. $\frac{13}{8} = 1.625$; $\frac{233}{144} = 1.61805$
- Having one Fibonacci number, the next/previous neighbor can be approximately calculated by multiplying/dividing it with golden ration,  
e.g. $5√ó1.618034=8.09017$ and $21√∑1.618034=12.97871$.
- Any Fibonacci number can be precisely calculated by using Binet's formula $F_n = \frac{\phi^n-(1-\phi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}$,  
e.g. $F_8 = \frac{\phi^8-(1-\phi)^8}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{\big(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\big)^8-\big(1-\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\big)^8}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{\frac{(1+\sqrt{5})^8}{2^8}-\frac{(1-\sqrt{5})^8}{2^8}}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{(1+\sqrt{5})^8-(1-\sqrt{5})^8}{2^8\sqrt{5}}=\frac{\big((1+\sqrt{5})^8-(1-\sqrt{5})^8\big)\sqrt{5}}{1280}=$  
$=\frac{\big(6016+2688\sqrt{5}-6016+2688\sqrt{5} \big)\sqrt{5}}{1280}=\frac{(5376\sqrt{5})\sqrt{5}}{1280}=\frac{26880}{1280}=21$
- There are numerous fascinating properties of the Fibonacci sequence yet to be explored (such as terms below zero, alternation of even and odd numbers, 1/89, etc).


## Algorithm Steps (Recursive)
1. Define the base case, based on the rule ¬´$F(0) = 0$¬ª and ¬´$F(1) = 1$¬ª.
2. Define the recursive case, based on the rule ¬´$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$¬ª.


# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
The program prompts the user to input a number representing the position of a Fibonacci number, calculates the corresponding Fibonacci value using a recursive algorithm, and then displays the result.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/Demonstration.png"/></p>


## Design Decisions
To prioritize simplicity and emphasize algorithm itself, several design decisions were made:
- Limiting the range of possible value for elements to $[0, 45]$, since computation of $46$ element exceeds the capacity of `int` variable $(2,147,483,647)$
- Assuming valid input values from the user.
- Omitting certain optimizations to the algorithm.


## Complete Implementation
Algorithm implemented within the function `fibonacci()`, which is declared in `Fibonacci.h` header file and defined in `Fibonacci.cpp` source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity and compilation efficiency. Examination of fibonacci sequence computation is conducted within the `main()` function located in the `Main.cpp` file. Below you can find related code snippets.

```cpp
  int fibonacci(int n) {
	  if (n <= 1) { return n; }
	  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
```


## Detailed Walkthrough
1. Start by setting up the base case, where if the input number is less than or equal to `1`, the function immediately returns the input value itself. This is because the Fibonacci sequence defines `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.
```cpp
  if (n <= 1) { return n; }
```
2. If the number is greater than `1`, the function recursively calls itself twice: once for `fibonacci(n - 1)` and once for `fibonacci(n - 2)`. The results of these two recursive calls are added together to produce the Fibonacci number for the input `n`. This continues until the base case is reached for each recursive branch.
```cpp
	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
```



## Call Stack Interaction
1. First things first, the program calls `main()` function and its frame is added on top of the call stack.  <p align="center"><img src="./Images/Step_0.png"/></p>
2. When we encounter the call of `fibonacci(int n)` function, we add its frame (`fibonacci(5)`) on top of the call stack. As long as given number ($n=5$) is not equals to $0$ or $1$, we reach `return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);` this part of function, where start to add two another frames - `fibonacci(4)` for `fibonacci(n - 1)` and  `fibonacci(3)` for `fibonacci(n - 2)`:  <p align="center"><img src="./Images/Step_1.png"/></p> 
3. This process of breaking of problem continues until we delve to the base cases, therefore forming next sequence of calls: <p align="center"><img src="./Images/Step_2.png"/></p> 
4. Upon reaching base cases, the called functions now start to return values and pop off their frames from the stack. <p align="center"><img src="./Images/Step_3.png"/></p>
5. This visualization allows to see recursive nature in action and denoting, that there is no need to actually calculate some function calls, because they were already calculated in other area. Unfortunately, this implementation of recursion can't affect that, thats the area of memoization and dynamic programming. <p align="center"><img src="./Images/Step_4.png"/></p> 
6. So the control flow continues this process until we reach the initial (first) function call. <p align="center"><img src="./Images/Step_5.png"/></p>



# &#128202; Analysis
Understanding the characteristics of an algorithm is essential for choosing the right solution to a problem, as it reveals their impact on resource utilization, potential limitations and capabilities. Comparing the algorithm with other approaches provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses, helping to make informed decisions in various scenarios.


## Algorithm Characteristics
- **Time Complexity:**
    - $O(n!)$ ‚Äî every function calls two other functions.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** 
   - $O(n)$ ‚Äî maximum depth of the recursion tree is $n$.


## Algorithm Comparison
Will be Updated in the Future...



# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of an algorithm is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Common Use Cases
- **Fibonacci Heaps** ‚Äî sequence is used in priority queue data structures to manage heap-ordered trees. When two trees of the same rank are merged, the number of trees is reduced based on Fibonacci numbers, ensuring that the structure remains balanced and  contributing to the overall amortized time of operations.
- **Fibonacci Search** ‚Äî sequence is used in algorithm to search within sorted arrays. The sequence‚Äôs predictable growth pattern helps determine optimal probing positions, minimizing the number of comparisons during the search process.
- **Lagged Fibonacci Generator (LFG)** ‚Äî sequence is used in pseudo-random number generator. The recursive relationship of the sequence combines previous values with a lag, improving the statistical properties and period length of the generated sequence.

# &#x1F559; Origins
The first mention of sequence was around 200 BC done by Indian mathematician **Acharya Pingala** in his work on Sanskrit prosody. Though Pingala did not employ the modern notation or terminology, he comprehended the fundamental nature of the sequence and its correlation with the golden ratio. Later those series were mentioned by other indian mathematicians such as **Bharata Muni** and **Virahanka**,**Gopala**.

Centuries later, in 1170, an Italian mathematician named **Leonardo** was born in Pisa. As a teenager, he accompanied his father to work in the port city of Bugia, present-day Algeria, where he represented Italian merchants. In Bugia, Leonardo encountered numerous merchants using Hindi and Arab numerals in their calculations. Intrigued by the efficiency and simplicity of this numerical system, which contrasted with the widely used Roman numerals in Europe, Leonardo began to learn and appreciate the advantages of it.

Over the course of his life, Leonardo interacted with numerous merchants, absorbing knowledge from them and translating his insights into several books. These works covered the advantages of Hindu numerals, delved into various mathematical problems, explored geometry and delved into number theory. However, his most renowned contribution is arguably found in "Liber Abaci" (1202). In this book, Leonardo explained how adopting this numerical system could greatly simplify business transactions.

Besides popularizing the Hindu-Arabic numerical system, he introduced the discussed sequence while addressing a challenge linked to the proliferation of rabbit populations. Notably, he did not explicitly named it the "Fibonacci sequence." It was only later, as his books gained popularity, that the name "Fibonacci", derived from "filius Bonacci" (roughly meaning "son of the Bonacci family"), was coined by Franco-Italian historian Guillaume Libri in 1838 to distinguish him from other Leonardo.
