# &#128161; What is a Factorial
**Factorial of a Number (n!)** ‚Äî is a math operation, which represents product of all positive integers from number 1 to the given(n), e.g. $4! = 1√ó2√ó3√ó4 = 24$.

**Main Rules:**
- number must be a non-negative integer
- $0! = 1$ *(there is only one way to arrange 0 as element)*
- $n! = (n-1)!√ón$  



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation 
**Idea**  
The program prompts the user to input a number for which the factorial is to be calculated and then displays the resulting output.

## Iteration vs Recursion
Technically speaking, factorial can be implemented using both iterative and recursive approach. Even though, iterative solutions are often preferred over recursive ones (due to space complexity, performance, readabillity, stack overflow, optimization limitations), the last approach was chosen within the context of this repository's section.

The question was is which type of recursion should be picked for that particular algorithm. Upon researching this question, the priority took the the tail-recursion, due to its potential optimization(tail call optimization) by the compiler, hence this option is potentially more effective.


## Detailed Overview
1. In order to prioritize simplicity and highlight algorithm itself, `int` is picked as data type. 

2. For the same reasons, the algorithm is implemented within the function named `factorialTail(int n)`, and this function is separated into distinct files `factorialTail.h` and `factorialTail.cpp` away from `main.cpp`.

3. The program starts by asking user to enter a non-negative number within specified range and validates the input all via function `getUserInput()` in the `main.cpp` file. The range limit is dictated by the size of data type in order to prevent overflow. Therefore, the range for the number is $[0;12]$, because the factorial of $13 (6,227,020,800)$ exceeds the capacity of `int` variable $(2,147,483,647)$.
   ```cpp
   int getUserInput()
   {
	   int n = 0;

   	while (true)
	   {
	      std::cout << "Enter your number between 0 and 12: ";
		   std::cin >> n;

		   if (std::cin.fail() || n < 0 || n > 12)
		   {
			   std::cin.clear(); // ensure that stream is in a good state
			   std::cin.ignore(32767, '\n'); // clear from any remaining chars
			   std::cout << "Error: invalid input. Please try again.\n\n"; // inform
		   }
		   else { break; }
	   }

	   return n;
   }
   ``` 

5. Then control flow is directed to the `factorialTail(int n)` function, where until the number is not equal to zero, the recursive function will call itself:
    - **Base case** ‚Äî adheres to the rule $0! = 1$, establishing a termination point for the recursion.
    - **Recursive case** ‚Äî fulfills the other rule $n! = (n - 1)! √ó n$, breaking down the factorial calculation, until reaching the base case.
   ```cpp
   int factorialTail(int n)
   {
	   if (n == 0) { return 1; } // Base case
	   else { return (factorialTail(n - 1) * n); }; // Recursive case
   }
   ``` 

5. After the calculation is done, the program displays result, bids farewell to the user and awaits closure.

## Call Stack Interaction

To offer a comprehensive insight into the fundamental mechanics of this recursive approach, here is presented a step-by-step execution of the algorithm along with a detailed description of its interaction with the call stack.


1. Starting the recursion process with the input number 6

      <img src="./img/step_1.png" />
   </p>  

2. Invoking the recursive case repeatedly until the specified criteria are met (6 times).
   
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./img/step_2.png" />
   </p> 

3. Upon the 7th recursive call, when the value becomes 0, we initiate the base case.
   
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./img/step_3.png" />
   </p> 

4. Exiting the recursive process.  
   
   <p align="center">
      <img src="./img/step_4.png" />
   </p> 

5. This marks the phase where the recursion is concluding, and the process of returning the calculated value is underway.

   </p> 

6. Continuing this process until we reach the initial (first) function call.

   </p> 

7. Concluding the recursion by returning the final calculated value.

# &#128221; Usage

Practically speaking, factorial is a **number of different permutations** you can have with items. Consequently, is it widely used in the field of computer science, especially in combinatorics and probability theory. Here I'll provide only the fundamental overview of what you can think of, whenever you refer to the factorial, without overwhelming with redundant intricacies.

For better understanding of the topic, I'll govern the **Fundamental Counting Principle**, which states that if there are $m$ ways to do one thing and $n$ ways to do another, then there are $m√ón$ ways to do both. For example creating a meal, if you have $3$ different main courses, $4$ different side dishes and $2$ drinks, this means that you can create a meal in $3√ó4√ó2=24$ ways.  

Additionally, when selecting from a consistent pool of options (e.g. such as picking from a single shelf of books), it is crucial to note a key principle. With each selection of an element $n$, the available options for the next selection reduce by one $(n‚àí1)$ due to the previous selection. This reflects the diminishing pool of choices as elements are chosen **sequentially**.

**Well-known combinatoric operations involving factorials:**
1. **Permutation** ‚Äî is a distinct arrangement of **all (n)** elements of a finite set $S$  in a **particular order**.

   For example, if $S = \set{a, b, c}$, then $S$ has $6$ permutations $(3! = 6): abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba$.

   The formula is: $P(n) = n!$

2. **Arrangement (k-permutation)** ‚Äî is a distinct arrangement of **particular (k)** elements of a finite set $S$ in a **particular order**.

   For example, if $S = \set{a, b, c}$, then possible 2-permutations $(k = 2)$ are: $ab, ac, ba, bc, ca, cb$.

   The formula is: $A_n^k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$

3. **Combination**  ‚Äî is an **unordered** arrangement of **particular (k)** elements of a finite set $S$.

   For example, if $S = \set{a, b, c}$, then possible 2-combinations $(k = 2)$ are: $ab, ac, bc$.
   
   The formula is: $C_n^k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$
   

## Example #1: Basic
**Permutating 6 books on a shelf**  
The total number of ways to permutate these (6) books is:  
$P(n) = 6√ó5√ó4√ó3√ó2√ó1 = 6! = 720$.

**Placing 4 book on the second shelf**  
The total number of ways to arrange these (4) books apart from the first (6) is:  
$A_n^k = \frac{6!}{(6-4)!} = \frac{6√ó5√ó4√ó3√ó2!}{2!} = 6√ó5√ó4√ó3 = 360$

**Packing 3 books in a backpack**  
The total number of ways to pack these (3) books apart from second shelf (4) is:  
$C_n^k = \frac{4!}{(4-3)!3!} = \frac{4!}{1!3!} = \frac{4√ó3!}{1√ó3!} = \frac{4√ó1}{1√ó1} = 4$


## Example #2: Practical

As you may wonder, what is the practical value of factorials and their application in real-life scenarios? This curiosity is an excellent direction. Indeed, it's not always about knowing all possible arrangements; the real goal is often to find the right one.

Factorials prove to be a valuable tool in this challenge, as you observed earlier. Sometimes, to pinpoint the correct arrangement, you may need to consider all possibilities. This process of exploring all possibilities allows to approach challenges systematically, narrowing down choices and increasing the likelihood of finding the optimal solution, making it a powerful **strategy in problem-solving**.

**Practical example in project management**  
A team is tasked with scheduling a series of tasks for an upcoming event, aiming to arrange them in the most efficient order to meet deadlines and dependencies. Given the potential that there could be large number of tasks, instead of manually exploring all permutations, the team likely employs computational methods, leveraging algorithms that take advantage of factorial principles.


# &#x23F3; History
Throughout human history, we have proven to be inherently drawn to stories, as understanding and retaining information is more effective through narrative and association. Realizing the potential, this historical section is included, offering a versatile approach to additional comprehension.

While the exact historical moment of the discovery of factorials remains elusive, the concept likely emerged organically as mathematicians grappled with combinatorial questions over centuries. Unlike some mathematical concepts with well-documented stories, the origin of factorials might be attributed to the collective evolution of mathematical thought rather than a single revelatory moment.

However, the term **factorial** was coined by French mathematician **Christian Kramp** in **1808**. Kramp's notation $n!$ brought a standardized and concise representation to express the product of all positive integers up to $n$. This notation became widely adopted and is fundamental in modern mathematics.
