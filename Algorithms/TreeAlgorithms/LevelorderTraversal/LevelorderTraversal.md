# &#128161; Overview
**Levelorder traversal** is a fundamental algorithm for visiting nodes in a binary tree. The name «LEVELorder» reflects the fact that nodes are visited according to their depth level in the tree, starting from the root and moving downward level by level. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.

# &#x1F559; Origins
I couldn’t find any definitive records tracing its origins, so I’m assuming it naturally emerged when people started thinking about trees as a more natural, top-down structure rather than a recursive one.
