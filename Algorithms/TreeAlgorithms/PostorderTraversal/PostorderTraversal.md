# &#128161; Overview
**Postorder traversal** is a fundamental algorithm for visiting nodes in a binary tree. When you think of traversal names as root placement plus left-to-right reading order, it is possible to observe that the name ¬´POSTorder¬ª means the root is visited AFTER the left and right subtrees. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.

## Introduction
The algorithm visits both subtrees before processing the root node ‚Äî following the order Left-Right-Root in the standard version, and Right-Left-Root in the reversed version.


## Important Details
1. Can be implemented using **recursion** or **iteration**, but unlike inorder and preorder, iterative postorder is more complex due to the need to ensure both children are visited before the node; it often requires two stacks or clever use of a single stack with tracking.


## Algorithm Steps (Recursive)
**Standard Version:**
1. Set up the base case, stopping recursion when traversal reaches the end of a branch.
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree by calling the function on the left child.
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree by calling the function on the right child.
4. Process the current node (this step depends on the specific task at hand).

**Reversed Version:**
1. Set up the base case, stopping recursion when traversal reaches the end of a branch.
2. Recursively traverse the right subtree by calling the function on the right child.
3. Recursively traverse the left subtree by calling the function on the left child.
4. Process the current node (this step depends on the specific task at hand).

# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of an algorithm is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Common Use Cases
- **Tree Deletion or Cleanup** ‚Äî postorder traversal is commonly used when freeing memory or deleting tree nodes, because it ensures children are handled before their parent. This avoids accessing dangling pointers and respects dependency order during teardown.

- **Expression Tree Evaluation** ‚Äî postorder traversal corresponds to postfix notation (Reverse Polish notation), where operands are visited before their operator. It allows expression trees to be evaluated naturally using a stack-based approach, which is heavily used in interpreters and compilers.

- **Dependency Resolution & Build Systems** ‚Äî postorder traversal is used in systems like make, where tasks (nodes) depend on sub-tasks (children). By visiting dependencies first, postorder ensures everything a task needs is resolved before the task itself is executed.


## Some Practical Problems
Since postorder traversal is widely used in tree-related problems, common problems that involve it are best described in the [tree's respective section](../../../DataStructures/Tree/Tree.md#some-practical-problems).



# &#x1F559; Origins
I couldn‚Äôt find any definitive records tracing its origins, so I‚Äôm assuming it naturally emerged as people began exploring tree structures and needed a way to process children before their parent nodes. As recursion and bottom-up processing became more common, the Left-Right-Root order likely stood out as a clean way to finalize a node only after fully handling everything beneath it.
