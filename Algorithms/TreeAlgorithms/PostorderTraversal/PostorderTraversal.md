# &#128161; Overview
**Postorder traversal** is a fundamental algorithm for visiting nodes in a binary tree. When you think of traversal names as root placement plus left-to-right reading order, it is possible to observe that the name «POSTorder» means the root is visited AFTER the left and right subtrees. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.
