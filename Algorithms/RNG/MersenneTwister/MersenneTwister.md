# &#128161; Overview
The **Mersenne Twister** is a highly efficient pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) known for its long period and excellent statistical properties. Its name comes from the fact that its period length is a Mersenne prime, while «Twister» refers to the internal transformation step where the state vector is «twisted» through a series of bitwise operations to generate high-quality random numbers. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.
