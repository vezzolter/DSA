# &#128161; Overview
**Random number generation** is a widely used operation in computer science to acquire number(s) that can be count as random. It helps to exhibit desired statistical properties and behaviors in various algorithms and for all manner of applications, therefore it is important to truly understand the concept.

## Essential Terminology
- **Randomness** ‚Äî typically refers to the quality of unpredictability or lack of tracing pattern.
   - **Random Numbers** ‚Äî is a sequence of numbers, where each number was obtained by chance, having nothing to do with other number of the sequence.
- **RNG (Random Number Generator)** ‚Äî is a computational algorithm that produces sequences of numbers that exhibit randomness.
   - **PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator)** ‚Äî is a deterministic type of RNG that generates numbers that only appears to be random.
   - **TRNG (True Random Number Generator)** ‚Äî is a non-deterministic type of RNG that generates truly random numbers.
- **Seed** ‚Äî is an initial value used to initialize a PRNG. By setting a specific seed, it is possible to recreate the same sequence of random numbers, which can be useful for debugging or testing.
- **Period** ‚Äî is a number of unique values in the sequence before it starts to repeat, while for PRNG it is finite, for TRNG it is effectively infinite.
- **Entropy** ‚Äî is a degree of unpredictability of a sequence of data collected from hardware sources; i.e. the greater it is, the less predictable sequence is.
  - **Entropy Source** ‚Äî is a physical or computational process that provides random or unpredictable data; i.e. basically the source from where the entropy is collected, such as electronic noise.
- **Distribution** ‚Äî is a description of how values  are distributed.
  - **Uniform Distribution** ‚Äî where every value within a given range has the same probability of occurring.
  - **Normal (Gaussian/Bell) Distribution** ‚Äî where most values cluster around the mean, with fewer values farther from the mean.
  - **Binomial Distribution** ‚Äî where the distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
When implementing a RNG, it's essential to understand the fundamental techniques that drive its behavior and ensure its correct functionality. Additionally, recognizing the critical pitfalls and potential optimizations allows you to refine the implementation, making it more efficient and robust for various scenarios.


## How to Implement
The choice of RNG depends on the application's specific needs, including the balance between speed, randomness quality, and security. Generally, there are two main categories of generators:

**PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator)** ‚Äî is a deterministic type of RNG that generates numbers that only appears to be random. It is called that way because given the same starting conditions, it yields the same result.

**TRNG (True Random Number Generator)** ‚Äî is a non-deterministic type of RNG that generates truly random numbers. It involves exploiting inherently unpredictable physical processes related to hardware (e.g. quantum processes, radioactive decay, electronic noise, optical noise, etc).

# &#x1F559; Origins
In the early days, people relied on manual methods to generate random numbers for both scientific and everyday purposes. These methods included tossing coins, rolling dice, or drawing cards. The journey toward mechanical random number generation began with **Leonard Henry Caleb Tippett's** **1927** invention of a table containing over 40,000 random digits. This marked a significant milestone, paving the way for subsequent innovations, such as the **1939** machine by the British statisticians **Maurice George Kendall** and **Bernard Babington Smith**, which produced a table of 100,000 random digits.

In the realm of computer science, a major breakthrough came in **1946** when Hungarian-American mathematician and physicist **John von Neumann** introduced the concept of generating random numbers through a computer‚Äôs arithmetic operations with his middle square method. Although deterministic, this method was effective for many applications where the appearance of randomness was sufficient. Subsequent advancements included the development of the Lehmer generator in **1949** by American mathematician **Derrick Henry Lehmer** and the creation of the Linear Congruential Generator by **W. E. Thomson** and **A. Rotenberg** in **1958**. Modern examples of RNGs include the Mersenne Twister by Japanese mathematicians and computer scientists **Makoto Matsumoto** and **Takuji Nishimura** in **1997** and xorshift in **2003** by American mathematician and computer scientist **George Marsaglia**, both of which have become widely used.

Today, companies like **Cloudflare** have taken innovative approaches to RNG, exemplified by their use of a wall of about 100 lava lamps in their headquarters. A camera captures images of these lamps at regular intervals, converting the dynamic and unpredictable movements into a series of random numbers. These numbers serve as the foundation for creating secure
