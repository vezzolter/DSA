# &#128161; Overview
The **Middle-Square Method** is a simple and early pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) known for its historical significance. Its name comes from core steps: squaring the seed value and then extracting the middle digits from the result. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation for algorithmic design and tackling more complex problem-solving strategies.

## Introduction
The Middle-Square Method generates a sequence of numbers by squaring the current number (initially a seed) and extracting the middle digits from the result, which become the next number in the sequence.


## Important Details
1. The algorithm is highly dependent on choosing the correct seed to produce a good sequence in terms of randomness. A great sequence typically has no obvious patterns, cycles, or repetition over a substantial range of values. If the number of digits isn't carefully chosen (e.g., using a number with fewer digits), the method may quickly converge to zero or produce non-random looking sequences.
E.g. $seed = 3792$; $seed = 8256$.
2. Extracting the middle digits is the tricky part of algorithm, because the squared result can have more or fewer digits than expected, leading to poor randomness. This can be solved by padding the squared value with leading zeros to ensure a consistent length, or by using mathematical operations like division and modulus to isolate the middle digits directly without converting to a string.


## Algorithm Steps
1. Choose an initial seed value.
2. Square the seed value to get a larger number.
3. Extract a middle portion of digits from the result (typically with the same amount of digits as seed has).
4. Use extracted digits as the new seed value.
5. Repeat this process to generate required amount of numbers.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
The program prompts the user to enter the required amount of numbers, digits and specify the seed, then it performs a respective generation using PRNG named Middle-Square Method, and finally displays the result.

## Design Decisions
To prioritize simplicity and emphasize algorithm itself, several design decisions were made:
- Using fixed seed value to ensure reproducible results.
- Choosing range values that are easily interpretable by humans ($0-100$).
- Limiting the number of elements to relatively small ($10$).
- Assuming valid input values from the user.
- Omitting certain optimizations to the algorithm.


## Complete Implementation
PRNG algorithm implemented within the function `middleSquareMethod()`, which is declared in `MiddleSquareMethod.h` header file and defined in `MiddleSquareMethod.cpp` source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity and compilation efficiency. Examination of generated values is conducted within the `main()` function located in the `Main.cpp` file. Below you can find related code snippets.

```cpp
unsigned long long seed = 12345;
const int digits = 4;

unsigned long long middleSquareMethod() {
  unsigned long long squared = seed * seed;
  int power = static_cast<int>(pow(10, digits));
  int shift = digits / 2;
  unsigned long long randomNumber = (squared 
    / static_cast<unsigned long long>(pow(10, shift))) % power;
  seed = randomNumber;
  return randomNumber;
}
```

## Detailed Walkthrough
1. The first step is to square the current seed. Since squaring can result in large numbers that may overflow, the seed is cast to unsigned long long before multiplication to ensure the result fits in the data type.
```cpp
  unsigned long long squared = seed * seed;
```
2. The key challenge of the middle-square method is extracting the middle digits. The number of digits extracted depends on the total number of digits in the squared value, with adjustments based on whether the digit count is even or odd. The current implementation uses basic logic, and while it serves most basic use cases, it could be adapted or optimized for specific requirements. The digit extraction is straightforward, but edge cases may introduce issues if not handled carefully.
```cpp
  int power = static_cast<int>(pow(10, digits));
  int shift = digits / 2;
  unsigned long long randomNumber = (squared 
    / static_cast<unsigned long long>(pow(10, shift))) % power;
```
3. After extracting the middle digits, the new value becomes the updated seed, which is stored for future iterations. This new seed is returned for further use in the next iteration.
```cpp
  seed = randomNumber;
  return randomNumber;
```
4. To make the generated value more practical and human-readable, a user-defined range can be applied. The range is defined by `maxVal` and `minVal`, which translates to `[minVal, maxVal)` and adding $1$ ensures inclusivity of the maximum value, resulting in the range `[minVal, maxVal]`. The modulo operator is then used to confine the PRNG output within `[0, range]`. Adding `minVal` shifts the range to `[minVal, maxVal]`, ensuring the final value is within the user‚Äôs desired range, therefore can be tested easily.
```cpp
	for (int i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {
    int randomNumber = minVal + (middleSquareMethod() % (maxVal - minVal + 1));
		std::cout << " " << i + 1 << ":\t" randomNumber << () << std::endl;
  }
```



# &#128202; Analysis
Will be updated in the future...

> **Note:** I'm currently considering how to best structure this section, as it involves several characteristics that I find intriguing to explore, such as period, distribution, predictability, and correlation.



# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of an algorithm is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. While there aren‚Äôt specific problems designed to practice this exact approach, the concept of randomness it implements is essential for solving many foundational challenges that test the core idea of randomness itself, applicable across various algorithms. 


## Common Use Cases
- **Education** ‚Äî algorithm is used only in educational context. Its inefficiency, bad randomness distribution period and insecurity make it largely obsolete in modern software development context, even for niche applications.


## Some Practical Problems
- Refer to RNG's practical problems



# &#x1F559; Origins
The **Middle-Square Method** was one of the first attempts to use a computational approach to generate sequences of seemingly random numbers, proposed and described by Hungarian-American mathematician and physicist **John von Neumann** at a conference in **1949**. At the time of its invention, digital computers were still in their infancy, and there was a need for methods to generate sequences of numbers that appeared random for various scientific and engineering applications. While the method is rudimentary by modern standards and has well-known shortcomings, it laid the foundation for subsequent developments in pseudorandom number generation.
