# &#128161; Overview
The **Karatsuba Algorithm** is a multiplication algorithm, known for reducing the time complexity of this operation. It is named after its inventor, Anatoly Alexeyevich Karatsuba. Knowledge and understanding of it teaches the core principles of the divide-and-conquer paradigm, while also enhancing ability to approach algorithmic design with broader and more effective strategies.

## Introduction
**Karatsuba Algorithm** recursively splits the numbers into higher-order and lower-order halves. Normally, this would require 4 multiplications, but by cleverly substituting one of the multiplications with a combination of additions and subtractions, the algorithm reduces the number of multiplications to 3. This reduction leads to a faster overall time complexity, as multiplication dominates the computation cost.

# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers, multiplies them using the Karatsuba Algorithm, and displays the result.

## Design Decisions
To prioritize simplicity and emphasize algorithm itself, several design decisions were made:
- Using the highest possible built-in data type, `unsigned long long`.
- Limiting the operation only to positive numbers.
- Assuming valid input values from the user.
- Omitting certain optimizations to the algorithm.


## Complete Implementation
The Karatsuba algorithm is implemented within the `karatsuba()` function and its helper one,  `countDigits()`, both declared in `KaratsubaAlgorithm.h` header file and defined in `KaratsubaAlgorithm.cpp` source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity and compilation efficiency. The multiplication operation is examined within the `main()` function located in the `Main.cpp` file. Below you can find related code snippets.

```cpp
unsigned long long karatsuba(unsigned long long a, unsigned long long b) {
	if (a < 10 || b < 10) { return a * b; }

	int digitsInLarger = (countDigits(a) > countDigits(b)) ? countDigits(a) : countDigits(b);
	int half = digitsInLarger / 2;

	unsigned long long aHighHalf = a / (unsigned long long)pow(10, half); // 123456 / 10^3 = 123
	unsigned long long aLowHalf = a % (unsigned long long)pow(10, half); // 123456 % 10^3 = 456
	unsigned long long bHighHalf = b / (unsigned long long)pow(10, half);
	unsigned long long bLowHalf = b % (unsigned long long)pow(10, half);

	unsigned long long lowPart = karatsuba(aLowHalf, bLowHalf);
	unsigned long long crossPart = karatsuba((aLowHalf + aHighHalf), (bLowHalf + bHighHalf));
	unsigned long long highPart = karatsuba(aHighHalf, bHighHalf);

	return highPart * pow(10, 2 * half) + (crossPart - highPart - lowPart) * pow(10, half) + lowPart;
}
