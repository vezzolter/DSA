# &#128161; Overview
**Divide and Conquer** is a widely used problem-solving approach in computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler ones. It helps to design elegant and efficient algorithms for all manner of applications, making it important to truly understand the concept.

**Essential Terminology:**
- **Problem** ‚Äî is a task or challenge that requires a solution, typically defined by a set of inputs, constraints, and desired outputs. It can vary in complexity and scope, ranging from simple arithmetic calculations to complex optimization tasks.
  - **Sub Problem** ‚Äî is a smaller, more manageable instance of the original problem.
- **Problem-Solving Strategy** ‚Äî is a method of approaching a problem to find a solution.
- **Divide and Conquer** ‚Äî is a strategy that consists of 3 steps: 
  1. **Divide** ‚Äî brake down original problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
  2. **Conquer** ‚Äî solve each sub-problem independently.
  3. **Combine** ‚Äî combine those solutions to form solution to the original problem.
- **Decrease and Conquer** ‚Äî is a variation, which leaves only required subproblem and discards other, that are not considered further in the solution process because they don't contain the solution to the original problem, therefore this approach just simply reduces the size of the original problem; e.g. binary search divides problem in halves, but search occurs only in one.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation
The list of known divide and conquer algorithms is extensive and continues to grow. When it comes to implementation, some share some common ideas, while others possess distinctive characteristics. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the cases at hand. Generally, there are lot of ways to achieve behavior of this approach, most used of them are:
- **Recursion** ‚Äî solves each sub-problem either by recursively dividing again or if small enough solves directly; e.g. merge sort.
- **Iteration** ‚Äî divides the problem in each iteration of the loop until original problem is solved; e.g. binary search.

> Personal note: Since you can observe the ideas of Divide and Conquer in many other approaches (probably due to its extremely general steps), it could be quite confusing to determine which specific implementation is being considered. In most cases I have encountered, Divide and Conquer is associated with recursion. Therefore, I recommend associating it as the default approach, but not limiting your design thinking only to it.



# &#128202; Analysis
The analysis of Divide and Conquer generally hinges on the assessment of the underlying implementation approach taken. For instance, if recursion is employed, one would need to construct the recurrence relation and solve it to determine the time complexity (please refer to the [Recursion section](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/Recursion/Recursion.md) for detailed guidance on this process). However, for algorithms like binary search, which are typically implemented iteratively, the same steps cannot be applied to estimate their complexity.



# &#128221; Application
**Some of the Most Well-Known Use Cases in Various Fields:**
- **Sorting** ‚Äî divide and conquer strategies are used in sorting algorithms to optimize the process of arranging data in a specific order. They achieve this by efficiently partitioning the data into smaller subsets, sorting each subset independently, and merging them back together to achieve the final sorted result. E.g. Merge sort, Quicksort, Heap sort.
- **Searching** ‚Äî divide and conquer approach enhances searching algorithms by efficiently locating specific elements within a dataset. These algorithms partition the search space into smaller segments, recursively searching each segment, and converging on the target element or determining its absence, thereby facilitating efficient search operations. E.g. Binary search, maximum and minimum element search.
- **Matricex Operations** ‚Äî divide and conquer techniques are applied to matrix operations. These techniques break down the matrices into smaller sub-matrices, perform computations recursively, and combine the results, enabling efficient matrix manipulations. E.g. Strassen's algorithm, recursive algorithms for matrix exponentiation
- **Computational Geometry** ‚Äî divide and conquer algorithms are used in computational geometry to solve geometry problems. These algorithms partition the geometric space, solve sub-problems independently, and combine the results to achieve geometric solutions efficiently. E.g. Graham Scan, QuickHull, Voronoi diagrams.
- **Numerical Methods** ‚Äî divide and conquer methods are used in numerical methods to solve mathematical problems using numerical approximations and algorithms. These methods break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, perform recursive computations, and combine the results to achieve efficient solutions. E.g. Simpson's Rule, Newton-Raphson method, Bisection method.

# &#x1F559; Origins
The idea of dividing one complex problem, solving them independently, and yielding the result dates back to ancient times, where it has been utilized for centuries in various cultures. In the realm of mathematics and computer science, the formalization and systematic study of divide and conquer algorithms began in the mid-20th century with the development of computer science as a field of study. Among the first introduced algorithms that utilized this idea were **Merge Sort** and **Quicksort**. From that point on, it gained widespread adoption and became a fundamental strategy in algorithm design and analysis.
