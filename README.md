# &#128161; About
Greetings! In this repository I'm dedicated to mastering problem-solving approaches & techniques, building a solid theoretical foundation and exploring a variety of data structures & algorithms using the C++ programming language. With a commitment to practical application, I explore these critical components of computer science, continuously enhancing my skills and knowledge along the way.



# &#128193; Repository Structure
This list provides a straightforward overview of the repository's contents. For a better navigation, сompleted projects (but still can receive updates) are marked with ✅ and ones currently under development with 🔄. The order in which they are arranged primarily serves the purpose of facilitating learning, namely, starting with the upper projects enables better comprehension of the subsequent ones.
