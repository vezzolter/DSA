# &#128161; About
Greetings! In this repository I'm dedicated to mastering problem-solving approaches & techniques, building a solid theoretical foundation and exploring a variety of data structures & algorithms using the C++ programming language. With a commitment to practical application, I explore these critical components of computer science, continuously enhancing my skills and knowledge along the way with a hope, that one day this repository will be a great practical learning resource for others.



# &#128193; Structure
This list provides a straightforward overview of the repository's contents. For a better navigation, completed projects (although they still can receive updates to improve quality) are marked with «✅», currently paused ones with «🔄», the main target under development with «🎯», and projects I am still considering adding are marked with «❔». The order in which they are arranged primarily serves the purpose of facilitating learning, namely, starting with the upper projects enables better comprehension of the subsequent ones. Please note, that this structure will remain dynamic and adaptable throughout its evolution.

&#127760; **Web-Sites:**  
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
  - A simple starting point. Many people dislike Wikipedia as a "source," but at the very least, it allows you to trace the original sources and verify them yourself — unlike some "guides" or "tutorial" sites that many people recommend.

- [CppCoreGuidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)
  - Essentially just guidelines for coding style, but in real-life development, everyone follows their own conventions. It’s not a strict cookbook, but rather a helpful reference if you don’t have your own style established yet.

**Ideas for Consideration:**
- **Origins Structure** — I believe it would be valuable to have a structured approach for examining a data structure or algorithm from a historical perspective — a heuristic or shortcut that distills just enough information to grasp its core idea and evolution. To achieve this, the first step should be defining the key aspects to analyze. These may include: the original problem that led to its creation, the initial attempts to solve it and why they failed, the thought process that led to the breakthrough, how the first solution emerged and evolved, the major contributions and updates made over time, its current state and potential future developments, etc. These kinds of questions would help others understand the thought processes of the people who created these structures, allowing them to mentally simulate the situations in which those ideas emerged. I believe that knowing this information would significantly enhance the way we teach problem-solving today and would serve as valuable documentation for future generations. One major challenge, however, is that finding answers to such questions can be difficult. Many early developments were poorly documented, and historical truths are often vague, hidden, or distorted due to human nature.
- **Template Coverage in Data Structures** — in the initial versions of my data structures, I implemented them using templates. However, I soon realized that properly implementing generic versions requires significant effort and involves many complex nuances. As a result, I reworked the data structures to use one type versions instead, as they are much better for learning purposes. That said, I still want this repository to cover the use of templates, as they are fundamental to how data structures are implemented in real libraries. The first key aspect to explore is how data structures are designed to store user-defined types and how they handle them internally. This knowledge is important, but implementing everything alone would take more time than is rational. For example, instead of building a single, fully optimized array implementation (which, due to my current level of experience, might still miss certain edge cases), I can focus on creating more data structures that are tailored toward one of the simplest types. This way, I believe it would provide more useful knowledge to more people.
- **Move Mechanics in Data Structures** — currently, move semantics are not implemented in the data structures. Adding support for move constructors and move assignment operators would be a significant improvement, making the implementations more efficient and modern.
- **Analysis for RNGs** — it would be interesting to add statistical testing for random number generators, including visualizations such as scatter plots to observe key properties like period, variation, spread, and distribution. This would help in analyzing the quality and behavior of different RNGs, making it easier to identify patterns or biases.
