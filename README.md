# &#128161; About
Greetings! In this repository I'm dedicated to mastering problem-solving approaches & techniques, building a solid theoretical foundation and exploring a variety of data structures & algorithms using the C++ programming language. With a commitment to practical application, I explore these critical components of computer science, continuously enhancing my skills and knowledge along the way with a hope, that one day this repository will be a great practical learning resource for others.



# &#128193; Structure
This list provides a straightforward overview of the repository's contents. For a better navigation, —Åompleted projects (although they still can receive updates to improve quality) are marked with ‚úÖ, currently paused ones with üîÑ and the main target under development with üéØ. The order in which they are arranged primarily serves the purpose of facilitating learning, namely, starting with the upper projects enables better comprehension of the subsequent ones. Please note, that this structure will remain dynamic and adaptable throughout its evolution.
