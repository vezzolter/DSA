# &#128161; Overview
**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is an implementation of binary tree, designed to organize data for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. The name reflects its key feature: enabling fast searches by maintaining a sorted hierarchical structure. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation in designing data structures and optimizing their application.
