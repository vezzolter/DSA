# &#128161; Overview
The **Binary Search Tree (BST)** stands out as one of the most common implementation of a binary tree. Its name is derived from one of the main operations performed on it, which is searching for a specific element This subsection explores BST to establish a solid knowledge of the ideas behind it, as it helps to create elegant and efficient algorithmic designs for all manner of applications.

**Binary Search Tree** — is a binary tree, which organizes elements in a sorted manner by following this **property:** for every node, all values in the left subtree are less than the value of the node, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the value of the node.

---
**Important Details:**
- **Duplicates** — while some implementations disallow duplicates elements, some allow. The question is how to handle them is up to developer, one common approach is to add counter to each node and simply update it.
- **Balance** — insertion and deletion can affect the balance of the BST, meaning that the heights of the left and right subtrees of nodes may differ significantly. If that happens tree may still function correctly, but it may exhibit degraded performance (both space and time), especially for large datasets. To prevent this, balancing mechanisms may be employed (e.g. AVL, Red-Black).
