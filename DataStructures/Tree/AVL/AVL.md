# &#128161; Overview
The **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing implementation of the binary search tree (BST) that strictly maintains height balance by enforcing a maximum difference of 1 between subtree heights at every node. The tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who introduced it in 1962 as the first self-balancing BST. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation in designing data structures and optimizing their application.
