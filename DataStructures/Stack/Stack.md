# &#128161; What is the Stack
The **Stack** stands out as one of the most fundamental abstract data type (ADT) in computer science that serves as a linear collection of elements, which becomes particularly valuable when you need to manage entities (e.g. data, objects, persons, events, tasks) in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner. It is named this way, because of how it resembles the behavior of adding or removing items from the top of a physical stack. This subsection explores the stack ADT not only to enhance comprehension of its concepts, but also to establish a solid foundation for a more complex algorithmic designs and problem-solving strategies.

**Essential Terminology:**
- **Stack** ‚Äî is a ADT that serves as a linear collection that operates on the LIFO principle.
- **Top** ‚Äî is the end of the of a collection at which elements are added and removed.
- **Bottom** ‚Äî is the end of the of a collection opposite to the top.
- **Push** ‚Äî is an operation of adding an element to the top.
- **Pop** ‚Äî is an operation of removing an element from the top.
- **Peek** ‚Äî is an operation of returning a value of element at the top.
- **Overflow** ‚Äî is a condition that occurs when trying to push an element onto a full stack.
- **Underflow** ‚Äî is a condition that occurs when trying to pop an element from an empty stack.

What identifies the data structure as stack is not the implementation but the interface: the user is only allowed to pop or push elements with few other helper operations. The interface includes next common operations:
- **push** ‚Äî inserts element at the top.
- **pop** ‚Äî removes the top element.
- **peek** ‚Äî accesses the top element.
- **empty** ‚Äî checks whether the container adaptor is empty.
- **size** ‚Äî returns the number of elements.

When it comes to the underlaying data structure, a stack generally can be broadly classified into two types: 
- **Array-Based Stack** ‚Äî utilizes a fixed-size or dynamic array to store elements.  
- **List-Based Stack** ‚Äî utilizes a singly, doubly or circular linked list to store elements.

While these types share some common ideas, each possesses distinctive characteristics related to the "base" of ADT. For example, while frequent insertion/removal on array can lead to a quite resourceful reallocation, those same operations in linked list require dereferencing. Overall the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the case at hand.
