# &#128161; Overview
**Stack** refers to both an abstract data structure and a concrete container, that operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The term _«stack»_ comes from this real-world analogy of stacking objects on top of each other, much like stack of dishes where the topmost item is the first to be accessed. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation in designing data structures and optimizing their application.

## Essential Terminology
- **Abstract Data Structure** — is a theoretical model that defines a set of operations and guarantees for organizing and manipulating data, independent of memory organization or specific implementation details.
  - **Data Structure** — is a theoretical model of data organization in memory, used to design containers in an efficient or specific ways.
  - **Container** — is a concrete implementation, used to manage actual data through specific operations. Containers are primarily defined by the operations and guarantees they provide, which can originate from the data structure itself or from an abstract data structure. As long as those guarantees are fulfilled, the underlying model can be modified or replaced.
- **Stack** — refers to both an abstract data structure and a concrete container, that operates on a LIFO principle. This dual nature arises from its ability to represent a conceptual guarantee of functionality while being implemented in diverse ways.
  - **Top** — is the end of the collection at which elements are added and removed.
  - **Bottom** — is the end of the collection opposite to the top.

# &#x1F559; Origins
Due to the simple and natural concept of this data structure it was quite common in computer programming from the earliest days and its origins cannot be attributed to a single individual, rather it reflects the collective ingenuity of humanity. However, it is still possible to retrace a few notable contributions to understanding of stack to the following people **Jan Lukasiewicz**, **Konrad Zuse**, **Alan Mathison Turing**, **Charles Leonard Hamblin** and most notably **Klaus Samelson** with **Friedirch Ludwig Bauer**, who in March 1988 received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award for the invention of the stack principle.
