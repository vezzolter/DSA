# &#128161; Overview
**Static array** is an implementation of an array where the size is fixed, meaning it can't be changed during runtime. Its name comes from this characteristic. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation in designing data structures and optimizing their application.

## Important Details
1. **Size (Fixed)** ‚Äî static array has a fixed size, meaning the size can't be changed during runtime.
2. **Time for Allocation (Compile)** ‚Äî static array requires knowing size at a compile time, meaning its size can only be based on values known during the compilation phase.
3. **Place for Allocation (Stack)** ‚Äî static array usually allocated in the stack memory section, limiting its size to relatively small amounts (since stack memory is limited). However, static arrays can also be allocated in the global/static/heap memory section, though this is less common.
4. **Memory Management (Automatic)** ‚Äî static array allocated on stack doesn't require manual memory management, meaning the system automatically handles allocation and deallocation, avoiding risks such as dangling pointers or memory leaks.


## Container Methods
When working with static array, it's important to note that there is no universal standard defining a strict list of operations or guidelines for how they should be implemented. The design and functionality of a container can vary depending on several factors, such as the programming language, the purpose of the library, performance considerations, etc. Despite these variations, there are still common operations found across most implementations, typically derived from the fundamental needs of data manipulation, like accessing, modifying, or iterating over elements. Since this repository is dedicated to C++, the operations provided will closely resemble those found in `std::array`.

---
**Compiler Generated:**
- **Default Constructor** ‚Äî creates a new array: for primitive data types allocates space without initializing, for complex data types calls their corresponding constructors.
- **Copy Constructor** ‚Äî creates a new array by copying elements from another array.
- **Move Constructor** ‚Äî creates a new array by moving elements from another array, leaving the original array in a valid, but unspecified state. This avoids the overhead of copying and instead merely shifts the ownership of the memory.
- **Copy Assignment Operator** ‚Äî overwrites every element of already existing array with the corresponding element of another array by copying them.
- **Move Assignment Operator** ‚Äî overwrites every element of already existing array with the corresponding element of another array by moving them, leaving the original array in a valid, but unspecified state. This avoids the overhead of copying and instead merely shifts the ownership of the memory.
- **Destructor** ‚Äî performs end-actions on array: for primitive data types does nothing because they don't hold resources that need to be explicitly cleaned up, for complex data types calls the corresponding destructors.

**Iterators:**
- `begin`, `cbegin` ‚Äî returns an iterator (or constant iterator) to the first element.
- `end`, `cend` ‚Äî returns an iterator (or constant iterator) to the position one past the last element, making range $[begin, end)$ easy for traversal.
- `rbegin`, `crbegin` ‚Äî returns an iterator (or constant one) to the last element.
- `rend`, `crend` ‚Äî returns an iterator (or constant one) to the position one before the first element, making range $[rend, rbegin)$ easy for traversal.

**Element Access:**
- `at()` ‚Äî returns specified element with bounds checking; if element is not within the range of the container, throws an exception.
- `operator[]` ‚Äî returns specified element without bounds checking; accessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.
- `front()` ‚Äî returns the first element in the container; calling on an empty container causes undefined behavior.
- `back()` ‚Äî returns the last element in the container; calling on an empty container causes undefined behavior.

---
**Capacity:**
- `empty()` ‚Äî returns `true` if container is empty, otherwise `false`.
- `size()` ‚Äî returns the number of elements in the container; basically distance from begin to end.

---
**Operations:**
- `assign()` ‚Äî assigns the given value to the elements.
- `swap()` ‚Äî exchanges the contents of the container with other given container; doesn't cause iterators and references to associate with the other container.



# &#x1F4BB; Implementation 
The implemented console application demonstrates the basic functionality of the static array, allowing users to perform various operations and interactions with it. The program provides a clear view of changes made during usage, displaying the state of the data at different stages to illustrate its simplified behavior and characteristics.

## Design Decisions
To prioritize simplicity and emphasize data structure itself, several design decisions were made:
- Resembling the behavior of `std::array` to provide familiarity for users.
- Restricting the implementation to the `int` data type to avoid the use of templates.
- Not considering cases where the container is created on the heap.
- Omitting certain optimizations to the container.
- Assuming valid input values from the user.
- Avoiding any exception handling.
