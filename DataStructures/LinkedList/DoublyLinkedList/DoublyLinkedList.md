# &#128161; Overview
**Doubly Linked List** is an implementation of a linked list where each node, except the first and the last one, points both to the next and to the previous node in the sequence, allowing bidirectional traversal from the first to the last node and back. The name comes from the fact that each node has doubled the number of links, compared to a singly linked list. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation in designing data structures and optimizing their application.

# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of a container is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Common Use Cases
As mentioned in the [LinkedList.md](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/blob/split-list/DataStructures/LinkedList/LinkedList.md), the concrete use cases (and anti use cases) directly derive from the advantages (and disadvantages) of the container, so there is no need for this sort of rephrasing. Since doubly linked lists share the foundational principles of the general concept of linked lists, their common usage is best described in the [linked lists respective section](../LinkedList.md#-application).


## Some Practical Problems
Since doubly linked lists share the foundational principles of the general concept of linked lists, their common problems is best described in the [linked lists respective section](../LinkedList.md#-application).



# &#x1F559; Origins
