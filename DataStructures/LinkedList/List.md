# &#128161; What is the Linked List

A linked list, a fundamental data structure in computer programming, becomes particularly valuable when the primary objective involves traversing a collection of items sequentially, one by one. In contrast to arrays, linked lists allow for non-contiguous memory allocation, offering a dynamic and flexible approach to data organization.

This subsection explores the Abstract Data Type (ADT) of Linked List not only to enhance understanding, but also to establish a solid foundation for approaching more intricate data structures.

**Linked List** ‚Äî is a linear data structure, consists of elements named as nodes that are linked together using pointers, because they are not necessarily adjacent in memory. It introduces the following essential terms:
- **Node** ‚Äî each individual element contained within the list. Consists of two main components: data and pointer.
- **Data** ‚Äî holds the actual value associated with the node.
- **Pointer** ‚Äî stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence.
- **Head** ‚Äî first node in the list.
- **Tail** ‚Äî last node in the list.

---

When it comes to implementation, lists can be broadly classified into three types: singly linked list, doubly linked list and cirular linked list. While these types share some common ideas, each possesses distinctive characteristics. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the case at hand.

**Singly Linked List** ‚Äî is a list, each node contains only one pointer to the next node in the sequence, enabling unidirectional traversal: forward from the head to the tail. The last node's "next pointer" points to nullptr, indicating the end of the list.


<p align="center"><img src="./img/structureSLL.png"/></p>

**Doubly Linked List** ‚Äî is a list, where each node contains an additional pointer to the previous node in the sequence enabling bidirectional traversal: forward from the head to the tail and backward from the tail to the head. The first node's "previous pointer" and the last node's "next pointer" point to nullptr, indicating the start and end of the list, respectively.

<p align="center"><img src="./img/structureDLL.png"/></p>

**Circular Linked List** ‚Äî is a list, where the last node points back to the head node. Allow for circular traversal, which can be unidirectional (if nodes are singly linked) or bidirectional (if nodes are doubly linked).

**Common Operations for ADT Linked List:**
- **Traversal** ‚Äî iterating through the elements of the list.
- **Acess** ‚Äî retrieving or updating the value of an existing element.
- **Insertion** ‚Äî adding a new element to the list.
- **Deletion** ‚Äî removing an element from the list.
- **Search** ‚Äî locating a specific element within the list.
- **Sorting** ‚Äî arranging the elements of the list in a specific order.
- **Merging** ‚Äî combining two lists into one.
- **Splitting** ‚Äî dividing the list into two or more parts.
- **Filtering** ‚Äî selecting specific elements based on certain criteria.

**"Size-Consistent" Operations**

Lists provide **sequential access** meaning that we need to traverse the list's elements one by one in order to access them, which certainly requires time. Furthermore, as as the number of nodes in the list increases, the time required to traverse to a particular location also does. This results in the conclusion, that linked lists are not the preferred option in scenarios where you have to perform lots of operation that dona lot or the data structure size remains constant, although they still can be a natural fit for some cases.

---

**"Size-Manipulating" Operations**

The true power of linked lists lies in the flexible nature of the size. Dynamic memory allocation of lists allow for flexible resizing, making them suitable for scenarios where the size of the data structure needs to change frequently. All of the "size-manipulating operations" are based on the the principle of "updating" nodes' pointers. Rather than delving into the intricacies of every possible operation, I'll illustrate a fundamental example of deleting an element that encapsulates the essence of the concept.

# &#x1F4BB; Implementation 
Discussing ADT, it's evident that well-established and widely recognized implementations already exist for singly, doubly and circular linked lists. In the context of C++, `std::forward_list` is a representative of singly linked list, and `std::list` stands as the counterpart for doubly linked list. Both of them, can be altered to create circular structure via manual pointers manipulation.  It's commonly recommended to rely on these proven implementations rather than reinventing the wheel. However, within the scope of this subsection, we'll take a closer look at simplified versions of these lists. This exploration is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts that underlie them.

# &#128202; Analysis

**Advantages:**
- **Efficient Element Rearraging** ‚Äî elements is efficient due to simple change of pointers, e.g. insertion and deletion takes $O(1)$ time.
- **Diverse Memory Allocation** ‚Äî in some scenarios, where it is hard to allocate a single-block of memory, linked list can come in handy, due to the distribution of cells throughout the memory.
- **Minimizing Unused Space** ‚Äî unused nodes can be removed, preventing them from occupying memory cells intended for other data.

---

**Disadvantages:**
- **Inefficient Sequential Access** ‚Äî in order to reach a specific element, it is necessary to traverse through the other elements first, e.g. access and search takes $O(n)$ time.
- **Additional Memory Consumption** ‚Äî each node requires memory allocation not only for the data but also for the pointers.



# &#128221; Application

**Some of the Most Well-Known Use Cases:**
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** ‚Äî graph path traversal algorithms and various data structures like stacks, queues, hash tables, tree and graphs representations often use lists as their underlying structure.

- **Back/Next Functionality** ‚Äî linked lists are commonly utilized in implementing back/next navigating functionality, such as in web browsers with nodes as web pages or music players with nodes as songs.

- **Undo/Redo Functionality** ‚Äî something similar to previous point, but desribes the cases, where each action performed by the user is stored as a node in separate linked lists, therefore allowing users to revert to previous states of the application or redo previously undone actions by traversing the respective lists.

- **Scheduling/Ordering** ‚Äî each task or element is represented as a node in the linked list, and scheduling decisions are made based on the order (by priority, arrival time, or other criteria) of nodes in the list. 

- **File System Management** ‚Äî lists used in file system management for maintaining directory structures, file metadata, and file allocation tables, where each directory entry or file descriptor is stored as a node, facilitating efficient traversal and manipulation of file system objects.

**Common Practical Problems:**
- Reverse a linked list.
- Delete without head pointer.
- Remove duplicate elements from sorted linked list.
- Mergea linked list into another linked list at alternate positions.
- Finding the length of a loop in linked list.
- Occurence of an integer in a Linked List.
- Convert singly linked list into circular linked list.
- Merge two sorted linked lists.
- Intersection point of two Linked Lists.
- Swap Kth node from beginning with Kth node from end in a Linked List.
- Convert a given Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List.
- Rearrange a given linked list in-place.
- Flattening a Linked List.
- Partition a linked list around a given value.
- Move Last Element of Linked List to Front.
- Sort a Linked List which is already sorted on absolute values.
