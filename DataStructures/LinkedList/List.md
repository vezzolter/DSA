# &#128161; What is the Linked List

A linked list, a fundamental data structure in computer programming, becomes particularly valuable when the primary objective involves traversing a collection of items sequentially, one by one. In contrast to arrays, linked lists allow for non-contiguous memory allocation, offering a dynamic and flexible approach to data organization.

This subsection explores the Abstract Data Type (ADT) of Linked List not only to enhance understanding, but also to establish a solid foundation for approaching more intricate data structures.

**Linked List** ‚Äî is a linear data structure, consists of elements named as nodes that are linked together using pointers, because they are not necessarily adjacent in memory. It introduces the following essential terms:
- **Node** ‚Äî each individual element contained within the list. Consists of two main components: data and pointer.
- **Data** ‚Äî holds the actual value associated with the node.
- **Pointer** ‚Äî stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence.
- **Head** ‚Äî pointer to the first node in the list.
- **Tail** ‚Äî pointer to the last node in the list.

# &#128202; Analysis
Advantages:
- rearrange efficiently (you never have to move items): adding/removing elements requires only replacing the address
- memory can be allocated diversely - no need to allocated in one single block in arrays

---

Disadvantages:
- in order to get to the element you need to traverse whole array
- when there's no space left in memory insertions can fail.

---

Common Operations Runtime:
- reading $O(n)$
- insertion $O(1)$
- deletion $O(1)$
