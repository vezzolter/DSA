# &#128161; Overview
The **Linked List** stands out as one of the most fundamental concept in computer science, that serves as a linear collection of elements, which becomes particularly valuable when the primary objective involves traversing a collection of items sequentially, one by one. It is named this way, due to the manner in which elements are connected via links to each other. This subsection explores linked list to establish a solid knowledge of the ideas behind it, as it helps to create elegant and efficient algorithmic designs for all manner of applications.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/List.png"/></p>


## Essential Terminology
- **Collection** ‚Äî is a data structure (or container), which is used to group multiple elements together.
  - **Linear Collection** ‚Äî is a type of collection, where elements are arranged in linear sequence, i.e. each element has a predecessor and a succressor, except for the first and last elements.
- **Linked List** ‚Äî is a linear collection, consists of elements named as nodes that are linked together using pointers, because they are not necessarily adjacent in memory.
- **Node** ‚Äî is an each individual element contained within the list, which consists of two main components:
  - **Data** ‚Äî is an actual information stored within the element.
  - **Pointer** ‚Äî is a pointer or reference, that stores the memory address of the next node in the sequence.
- **Head** ‚Äî is the first node in the list.
- **Tail** ‚Äî is the last node in the list.


## Important Details
Lists provide **sequential access** meaning that we need to traverse the list's elements one by one in order to access them, which certainly requires time. Furthermore, as as the number of nodes in the list increases, the time required to traverse to a particular location also does. This results in the conclusion, that linked lists are not the preferred option in scenarios where you have to perform lots of operation that dona lot or the data structure size remains constant, although they still can be a natural fit for some cases.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListTraversal.png"/></p>

---
The true power of linked lists lies in the flexible nature of the size. Dynamic memory allocation of lists allow for flexible resizing, making them suitable for scenarios where the size of the data structure needs to change frequently. All of the "size-manipulating operations" are based on the the principle of "updating" nodes' pointers. Rather than delving into the intricacies of every possible operation, I'll illustrate a fundamental example of deleting an element that encapsulates the essence of the concept.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListDeletion.png"/></p>


## Types of Lists
When it comes to classification, there are broadly three types of lists: singly linked list, doubly linked list and cirular linked list. While these types share some common ideas, each possesses distinctive characteristics. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the case at hand.

**Singly Linked List** ‚Äî is a list, each node contains only one pointer to the next node in the sequence, enabling unidirectional traversal: forward from the head to the tail. The last node's "next pointer" points to nullptr, indicating the end of the list.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListStructureSingly.png"/></p>

**Doubly Linked List** ‚Äî is a list, where each node contains an additional pointer to the previous node in the sequence enabling bidirectional traversal: forward from the head to the tail and backward from the tail to the head. The first node's "previous pointer" and the last node's "next pointer" point to nullptr, indicating the start and end of the list, respectively.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListStructureDoubly.png"/></p>

**Circular Linked List** ‚Äî is a list, where the last node points back to the head node. Allow for circular traversal, which can be unidirectional (if nodes are singly linked) or bidirectional (if nodes are doubly linked).
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListStructureCircular.png"/></p>


## Operation Details
- **Traversal** ‚Äî iterating through the elements of the list.
- **Access** ‚Äî retrieving or updating the value of an existing element.
- **Insertion** ‚Äî adding a new element to the list.
- **Deletion** ‚Äî removing an element from the list.
- **Search** ‚Äî locating a specific element within the list.
- **Sorting** ‚Äî arranging the elements of the list in a specific order.
- **Merging** ‚Äî combining two lists into one.
- **Splitting** ‚Äî dividing the list into two or more parts.
- **Filtering** ‚Äî selecting specific elements based on certain criteria.


# &#x1F4BB; Implementation 
Discussing ADT, it's evident that well-established and widely recognized implementations already exist for singly, doubly and circular linked lists. In the context of C++, `std::forward_list` is a representative of singly linked list, and `std::list` stands as the counterpart for doubly linked list. Both of them, can be altered to create circular structure via manual pointers manipulation.  It's commonly recommended to rely on these proven implementations rather than reinventing the wheel. However, within the scope of this subsection, we'll take a closer look at simplified versions of these lists. This exploration is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts that underlie them.


##  Singly Linked List | Design Decisions
Keeping its educational aim in mind, the `SLL` class developed here closely resembles the behavior of `std::forward_list`, with minor adjustments aimed at emphasizing simplicity and focusing on the core aspects of the data structure.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListSinglyLibItr.png"/></p>

One significant simplification is the omission of the iterator classes as a member variables. This decision was made to avoid the complexities associated with navigating the intricate hierarchy of iterator classes and templates found in `std::forward_list`, allowing to maintain focus on the key features of the ADT.


##  Singly Linked List | Detailed Overview
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListSinglyDemonstration.png"/></p>

Application's control flow and testing of the class is conducted within the [Main.cpp](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList/src/Main.cpp) file. The `SLL` class is declared in [SinglyLinkedList.h](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList/inc/SinglyLinkedList.h) header file and defined in [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList/src/SinglyLinkedList.cpp) source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity, and compilation efficiency, but for your convenience here is the declaration of the class:
```cpp
template<class T>
class SLL {
private:
	struct Node {
	public:
		T _data;
		Node* _next;

		// Special Member Functions
		Node(const T& newData, Node* nextNode = nullptr)
			: _data(newData), _next(nextNode) {}
		Node()                           = default;
		Node(const Node& rhs)            = delete;
		Node& operator=(const Node& rhs) = delete;
	};

	int _size;
	Node* _head;

public:
	// Special Member Functions
	SLL();
	// SLL(const std::initializer_list<T>& initList); remove due to init list
	SLL(const SLL& rhs);
	SLL& operator=(const SLL& rhs);
	~SLL();

	// Element Access
	T& operator[](const int index);
	const T& operator[](const int index) const;
	T& front();
	const T& front() const;

	// Capacity 
	bool empty() const;
	int size() const;

	// Modifiers
	void clear();
	void insertAfter(const int index, const T& newData);
	void eraseAfter(const int index);
	void pushFront(const T& newData);
	void popFront();
};
```


##  Doubly Linked List | Design Decisions
Keeping its educational aim in mind, the `DLL` class developed here closely resembles the behavior of `std::list`, with minor adjustments aimed at emphasizing simplicity and focusing on the core aspects of the data structure.
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListDoublyLibItr.png"/></p>

Application's control flow and testing of the class is conducted within the [Main.cpp](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList/src/Main.cpp) file. The `DLL` class is declared in [DoublyLinkedList.h](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList/inc/DoublyLinkedList.h) header file and defined in [DoublyLinkedList.cpp](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList/src/DoublyLinkedList.cpp) source file. This approach is adopted to ensure encapsulation, modularity, and compilation efficiency, but for your convenience here is the declaration of the class:

		// Special Member Functions
		Node(const T& newData, Node* nextNode = nullptr, Node* prevNode = nullptr)
			: _data(newData), _next(nextNode), _prev(prevNode) {}
		Node()                           = default;
		Node(const Node& rhs)            = delete;
		Node& operator=(const Node& rhs) = delete;

	void erase(const int index);
	void pushFront(const T& newData);
	void popFront();
	void pushBack(const T& newData);
	void popBack();
};
```

##  Circular Linked List | Design Decisions
Circular linked lists can be implemented based on either singly or doubly linked lists. This implementation doesn't fundamentally alter the functionality; rather, it changes how operations are performed. Unlike standard linked lists, there isn't a built-in container for circular linked lists in the STL. Therefore, I chose to implement it based on a doubly linked list for personal preference.



##  Circular Linked List | Detailed Overview
<p align="center"><img src="./Images/ListCircularDemonstration.png"/></p>

The concept behind creating this type of container revolves around ensuring that the tail node's next pointer points to the head and vice versa. This necessitates minor adjustments to the overall structure to avoid circular references. Specifically, it means you can't iterate through the list by checking for nullptr, and it requires assigning proper values to the pointers after making corresponding changes. For the complete implementation, please refer to the [project's directory](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/tree/main/DataStructures/LinkedList/CircularLinkedList). Here, I'll provide a simple examples:

You can't iterate via check for nullptr:
```cpp
// Deep copy assignment operator
template<class T>
CLL<T>& CLL<T>::operator=(const CLL& rhs) {
	// Self-assignment guard
	if (this == &rhs)
		return *this;

	clear();
	_size = rhs._size;

	// Case: empty list
	if (rhs._head == nullptr) {
		_head = _tail = nullptr;
		return *this;
	}

	_head = new Node(rhs._head->_data);
	Node* currentRhs = rhs._head->_next;
	Node* current = _head;
	Node* originalHead = rhs._head; // Save the original head of the list

	while (currentRhs != originalHead) {
		current->_next = new Node(currentRhs->_data);
		current->_next->_prev = current;
		current = current->_next;
		currentRhs = currentRhs->_next;
	}

	// Make the list circular
	_tail = current;
	_tail->_next = _head;
	_head->_prev = _tail;

	return *this;
}
```

You have to ensure, that referrences to the tail/head are proper:
```cpp
// Prepends the given element value to the beginning of the container
template<typename T>
void CLL<T>::pushFront(const T& newData) {
	Node* newNode = new Node(newData);

	// Case: empty list
	if (_size == 0) {
		_head = _tail = newNode;
		newNode->_next = newNode->_prev = newNode; // Make the list circular
	}
	else {
		// Push front
		newNode->_next = _head;
		newNode->_prev = _tail;
		_head->_prev = newNode;
		_head = newNode;

		// Update the tail's next pointer to point to the new head
		_tail->_next = _head;
	}

	++_size;
}
```



# &#128202; Analysis
Understanding how to analyze the particular implementation of a data structure in terms of time and space complexity is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring efficient resource utilization within the constraints of the given environment. Additionally, knowing the pros and cons of different data structures allows to make informed decisions, helping to choose the most suitable approach for a given problem.


## How to Analyze
Will be updated in the future...


## Advantages
- **Efficient Element Rearraging** ‚Äî elements is efficient due to simple change of pointers, e.g. insertion and deletion takes $O(1)$ time.
- **Diverse Memory Allocation** ‚Äî in some scenarios, where it is hard to allocate a single-block of memory, linked list can come in handy, due to the distribution of cells throughout the memory.
- **Minimizing Unused Space** ‚Äî unused nodes can be removed, preventing them from occupying memory cells intended for other data.

## Disadvantages
- **Inefficient Sequential Access** ‚Äî in order to reach a specific element, it is necessary to traverse through the other elements first, e.g. access and search takes $O(n)$ time.
- **Additional Memory Consumption** ‚Äî each node requires memory allocation not only for the data but also for the pointers.



# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of a data structure is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Some of the Most Well-Known Use Cases
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** ‚Äî graph path traversal algorithms and various data structures like stacks, queues, hash tables, tree and graphs representations often use lists as their underlying structure.
- **Back/Next Functionality** ‚Äî linked lists are commonly utilized in implementing back/next navigating functionality, such as in web browsers with nodes as web pages or music players with nodes as songs.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality** ‚Äî something similar to previous point, but desribes the cases, where each action performed by the user is stored as a node in separate linked lists, therefore allowing users to revert to previous states of the application or redo previously undone actions by traversing the respective lists.
- **Scheduling/Ordering** ‚Äî each task or element is represented as a node in the linked list, and scheduling decisions are made based on the order (by priority, arrival time, or other criteria) of nodes in the list. 
- **File System Management** ‚Äî lists used in file system management for maintaining directory structures, file metadata, and file allocation tables, where each directory entry or file descriptor is stored as a node, facilitating efficient traversal and manipulation of file system objects.

# &#x1F559; Origins
The concept of linked lists, renowned for their efficient dynamic memory management, has evolved over time and there is no single individual behind them, especially because historical origins are not always well-recorded. Documented mention of them comes from **Hans Peter Luhn** in **1953**, who conceived of linked lists as a solution for Chained Hash Maps. Nevertheless, the first notable contribution to the practical implementation of this concept in the field of programming comes from **Allen Newell**, **Cliff Shaw** and **Herbert Alexander Simon**, who developed Information Processing Language in **1955‚Äì1956** at RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University. From that point on in programming history, 
linked lists quickly gained widespread adoption and underwent continuous development by programmers worldwide, becoming a fundamental component in various programming languages and data structures.
