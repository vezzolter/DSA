# &#128161; Overview
**Singly Linked List** is an implementation of a linked list where each node, except the last one, points only to the next node in the sequence, allowing unidirectional forward traversal from the first to the last node. The name comes from the fact that each node has only a single link. Knowledge and understanding of it lay a solid foundation in designing data structures and optimizing their application.

## Important Details
1. **Node Composition** — each node in a singly linked list holds a data element and a pointer to the next node, creating a chain of elements connected sequentially. This structure is straightforward in design and requires minimal additional memory.

2. **Single-Directional Traversal** — nodes in a singly linked list can only be accessed in one direction, from the head towards the tail. This one-way traversal restricts operations to forward movement, without the ability to traverse backward through the list.

3. **End of List** — the last node in a singly linked list points to `nullptr`, which signifies the end of the list. This marker allows traversal functions to recognize where the list terminates.

# &#128221; Application
Understanding some of the most well-known use cases of a container is crucial for grasping its practical relevance and potential impact in real-world scenarios. Additionally, familiarizing oneself with common practical problems and practicing their solutions ensures that you remember the essential details and develop a deep, intuitive understanding of the functionality and limitations.


## Common Use Cases
As mentioned in the [LinkedList.md](https://github.com/vezzolter/DSA/blob/split-list/DataStructures/LinkedList/LinkedList.md), the concrete use cases (and anti use cases) directly derive from the advantages (and disadvantages) of the container, so there is no need for this sort of rephrasing. Since singly linked lists share the foundational principles of the general concept of linked lists, their common usage is best described in the [linked lists respective section](../LinkedList.md#-application).
